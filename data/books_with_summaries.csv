Using the first edition of the English translation prepared by Francis Bowen (Cambridge, Mass.: Sever and Francis, 1862) as the basis of the digital edition, it not only contains the text of the work but also citations and links to specific pages in the source materials used and/or cited by Tocqueville. Cited works, if in a language other than English, include links to English translations when available. If the cited source is in manuscript form, e.g., a letter by Thomas Jefferson, links are included not only to the manuscript, but to a transcription of the letter where available. Whenever possible, the digital version to which the text is linked is that of a specific edition cited by Tocqueville. In instances where the edition of a work was not clearly identified either by Tocqueville or elsewhere, the digital version is of a resource contemporary to Tocqueville. Additionally, to supplement the text, extensive editorial notes drawn from several other English translations have been matched to the text of the 'Bowen' edition. These are included as notes in the sources list within the library.

Economics in one lesson : the shortest & surest way to understand basic economics - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Hazlitt, Henry, 1894-1993","With over a million copies sold, Economics in One Lesson is an essential guide to the basics of economic theory. A fundamental influence on modern libertarianism, Hazlitt defends capitalism and the free market from economic myths that persist to this day.   Considered among the leading economic thinkers of the ""Austrian School,"" which includes Carl Menger, Ludwig von Mises, Friedrich (F.A.) Hayek, and others, Henry Hazlitt (1894-1993), was a libertarian philosopher, an economist, and a journalist. He was the founding vice-president of the Foundation for Economic Education and an early editor of The Freeman magazine, an influential libertarian publication. Hazlitt wrote Economics in One Lesson , his seminal work, in 1946. Concise and instructive, it is also deceptively prescient and far-reaching in its efforts to dissemble economic fallacies that are so prevalent they have almost become a new orthodoxy.  Economic commentators across the political spectrum have credited Hazlitt with foreseeing the collapse of the global economy which occurred more than 50 years after the initial publication of Economics in One Lesson . Hazlitt's focus on non-governmental solutions, strong - and strongly reasoned - anti-deficit position, and general emphasis on free markets, economic liberty of individuals, and the dangers of government intervention make Economics in One Lesson every bit as relevant and valuable today as it has been since publication.","New York : Currency, a member of the Crown Publishing Group, [202-?]©1979",English,,"""Henry Hazlitt's classic economics primer""-- Back cover.""Originally published in the United States by Three Rivers Press, an imprint of the Crown Publishing Group in 1988""--Title page verso.Originally published: New York : Harper & Brothers, ©1946.Includes bibliographical references and index.",218 pages ; 21 cm,,,1114268189.0,,010105352,"Economics in One Lesson is an essential guide to the basics of economic theory.

JAANUS : Japanese architectural and art net users system. - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Parent, Mary Neighbour","This dictionary contains approximately 8000 terms related to traditional Japanese architecture and gardens, painting, sculpture and art-historical iconography from approximately the 1st century A.D. to the end of the Edo period (1868). Terms from related fields such as lacquer, ceramics, textiles and metalwork have been included where they are considered to be of general interest and/or impact on the principal fields of architecture, painting and sculpture. These definitions are not translations from any one Japanese monolingual dictionary, but have been collated from a range of specialist sources and scholarly publications, and from direct observation and study. Many have never before been defined in English. The entries are arranged in alphabetical order: the romanized term is followed by Japanese characters and a definition in English. All Japanese words included within the definition are romanized, and provided with Japanese characters. An asterisk '*' before any word indicates a cross-reference to a separate entry. Basically, the Hepburn system of romanization has been used, although we follow the hiragana notation system for long vowels (ex. tourou rather than toro) due to the limitation of HTML language. We also have a separate illustrative file to show some special Kanji (Chinese characters) that are not supported by most Japanese word processors. Japanese and other non-English words, with the exception of proper names and entry headings, appear in italics. Different meanings or usages of the same term are listed numerically; 1, 2, 3 etc., but terms whose meaning differs in art history and architecture are treated as separate dictionary entries.","[Japan] : Japanese Architecture and Art Net Users System, c2001-",JapaneseEnglish,,"Title from title screen (last viewed March 9, 2009).In English and Japanese.",1 online resource,File type: text file,DictionariesOnline databases,318091406.0,,005069900,"This dictionary contains approximately 8000 terms related to traditional Japanese architecture and gardens, painting, sculpture and art-historical iconography from approximately the 1st century A.D. to the end of the Edo period (1868) Terms from related fields such as lacquer, ceramics, textiles and metalwork have been included where they are considered to be of general interest and/or impact on the principal fields of architecture, painting and sculpture.

Katharina Grosse: It Wasn't Us - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,,"The paintings of Katharina Grosse can appear anywhere. Her large-scale works are multi-dimensional pictorial worlds in which walls, ceilings, objects, and even entire buildings and landscapes, are coated with splendid color. For the exhibition It Wasn't Us, the artist has transformed the Historic Hall of Hamburger Bahnhof - Museum für Gegenwart - Berlin, as well as the outdoor space behind the building, into an expansive painting which radically destabilizes the existing order of the museum architecture.  The painting's support consists of the floor of the hall and a group of polystyrene forms designed specifically for the exhibition, which Grosse transposed into their final size in several working stages and through incremental changes of scale. The painting stretches beyond the building's confines and into public space, onto the vast grounds behind the museum, and across the façade of the Rieckhallen. It Wasn't Us does not connect interior and exterior, museum and environment, or culture and nature. Rather, it renegotiates our viewing habits and our forms of thought and perception.  Katharina Grosse (*1961, Freiburg im Breisgau), one of the most profiled female painters on the international contemporary art scene, studied at the Kunstakademie Münster, as well as at the Düsseldorf Academy, where she was also a professor from 2010 to 2018.

Oxford Handbook of Historical Political Economy - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,Jenkins,"The Oxford Handbook of Historical Political Economy brings together scholars who are working on essential and field-shaping topics in this burgeoning area. Historical Political Economy (HPE) is the study of how political and economic actors and institutions have interacted over time. It differs from much of economic history in that it focuses on the causes and consequences of politics. It departs from much of conventional political economy in that its context is strictly historical, even if/when it has implications for contemporary political economy. It also departs from much of history in its use of social-scientific theory and methods. Thus, while HPE involves elements of the traditional fields of economics, political economy, and history, it is separate from-and integrative of-them.  The Handbook includes contributions from leading scholars in political science, economics, sociology, and history. The first section summarizes the state of the field and provides an overview of the data and techniques typically used by HPE scholars. Subsequent chapters survey major HPE research areas in political economy, political science, and economics, as well as the long-run economic, political, and social consequences of historical political economy.  Various chapters in the Handbook will be of interest to economists, political scientists, sociologists, historians, legal scholars, and public policy scholars who study political-economy issues and topics from a historical perspective.

The Oxford handbook of philosophy and disability - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Wasserman, David T.","Disability raises profound and fundamental issues: questions about human embodiment and well-being; dignity, respect, justice and equality; personal and social identity. It raises pressing questions for educational, health, reproductive, and technology policy, and confronts the scope and direction of the human and civil rights movements.

The Oxford Handbook of Philosophy and Disability is the first comprehensive volume on the subject. The volume's contents range from debates over the definition of disability to the challenges posed by disability for justice and dignity; from the relevance of disability for respect, other interpersonal attitudes, and intimate relationships to its significance for health policy, biotechnology, and human enhancement; from the ways that disability scholarship can enrich moral and political philosophy, to the importance of physical and intellectual disabilities for the philosophy of mind and action. The contributions reflect the variety of areas of expertise, intellectual orientations, and personal backgrounds of their authors. Some are founding philosophers of disability; others are promising new scholars; still others are leading philosophers from other areas writing on disability for the first time.

Scaling migrant worker rights : how advocates collaborate and contest state power - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Bada, Xóchitl","A free ebook version of this title is available through Luminos, University of California Press's Open Access publishing program.

As international migration continues to rise, sending states play an integral part in ""managing"" their diasporas, in some cases even stepping in to protect their citizens' labor and human rights in receiving states. At the same time, meso-level institutions--including labor unions, worker centers, legal aid groups, and other immigrant advocates--are among the most visible actors holding governments of immigrant destinations accountable at the local level. The potential for a functional immigrant worker rights regime, therefore, advocates to imagine a portable, universal system of justice and human rights, while simultaneously leaning on the bureaucratic minutiae of local enforcement.

21st century guitar : evolutions and augmentations - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Perks, Rich (Guitarist)","In the 21st Century, the guitar, as both a material object and tool for artistic expression, continues to be reimagined and reinvented. From simple adaptations or modifications made by performers themselves, to custom-made instruments commissioned to fulfil specific functions, to the mass production of new lines of commercially available instruments, the extant and emergent forms of this much-loved musical instrument vary perhaps more than ever before. As guitars sporting multiple necks, a greater number of strings, and additional frets become increasingly common, so too do those with reduced registers, fewer strings, and fretless fingerboards. Furthermore, as we approach the mark of the first quarter-century, the role of technology in relation to the guitar's protean nature is proving key, from the use of external effects units to synergies with computers and AR headsets. Such wide-ranging evolutions and augmentations of the guitar reflect the advancing creative and expressive needs of the modern guitarist and offer myriad new affordances.  21st Century Guitar examines the diverse physical manifestations of the guitar across the modern performative landscape through a series of essays and interviews. Academics, performers and dual-practitioners provide significant insights into the rich array of guitar-based performance practices emerging and thriving in this century, inviting a reassessment of the guitar's identity, physicality and sound-creating possibilities.","New York : Bloomsbury Academic, 2023.©2023",English,,Includes bibliographical references and index.,"xi, 278 pages : illustrations (black and white) ; 24 cm",,InterviewsHistory,1320817900.0,LCCN: 2022022663British national bibliography: GBC2K0596,010850863,"21st Century Guitar examines the diverse physical manifestations of the guitar across the modern performative landscape.

21st Century Media and Female Mental Health : Profitable Vulnerability and Sad Girl Culture - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Thelandersson, Fredrika","This open access book examines the conversations around gendered mental health in contemporary Western media culture. While early 21st century-media was marked by a distinct focus on happiness, productivity and success, during the 2010s negative feelings and discussions around mental health have become increasingly common in that same media landscape. This book traces this turn to sadness in women's media culture and shows that it emerged indirectly as a result of a culture overtly focused on happiness. By tracing the coverage of mental health issues in magazines, among female celebrities, and on social media this book shows how an increasingly intimate media environment has made way for a profitable vulnerability, that takes the shape of marketable and brand-friendly mental illness awareness that strengthens the authenticity of those who embrace it. But at the same time sad girl cultures are proliferating on social media platforms, creating radically honest spaces where those who suffer get support, and more capacious ways of feeling bad are formed. Using discourse analysis and digital ethnography to study contemporary representations of mental illness and sadness in Western popular media and social media, this book takes a feminist media studies approach to popular discourse, understanding the conversations happening around mental health in these sites to function as scripts for how to think about and experience mental illness and sadness.

3D Printing for Construction with Alternative Materials - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Rangel, Bárbara","This book explores the latest achievements and design possibilities that 3D printing for construction (DPC) can offer, the alternative materials to natural aggregates or cement and even the 4th dimension that is already starting in this area. DPC materiality is starting to be explored in architecture as a new design language to reach not only outrageous forms but also to leverage the building process and its performance. Like Corbusier explored the concrete potentiality of concrete to release the façade and the plan, 3DPC is allowing to straighten design freedom with building performance. Industry and Scientific research are offering design professionals possibilities to start a new design movement. New paths are also starting to be tracked to reduce even more this building system footprint, stalking alternatives to Portland cement (PC). Today is already possible to build with the soil from the buildings' ground. Leftovers from various industries are opening possibilities to decrease the PC and natural aggregates rate in printable mortars. From the industry, salt is becoming a possibility to be used in 3DPC. Sugar can ashes are improving the mortar performance reducing adjuvants. Construction and demolition waste can substitute natural aggregates and even offer new textures and color possibilities. Finally, to close this edition, the latest steps on the use of Phase Change Materials in additive manufacturing are collected to raise awareness to the next step of AM, the 4D printing.","[Place of publication not identified] : Springer, 2023.",,,Title from content provider.,1 online resource,,,,,010853118,"This book explores the latest achievements and design possibilities that 3D printing for construction (DPC) can offer, the alternative materials to natural aggregates or cement.

A New Kirchhoff-Love Beam Element and its Application to Polymer Mechanics - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Schulz, Matthias C.","The novel finite element formulations fall into the category of geometrically exact Kirchhoff-Love beams. A prominent characteristic of this category is that the absence of shear deformation is strongly enforced by removing two degrees of freedom. Further, the corresponding beam theories exhibit not only translational but also rotational degrees of freedom and their configurations thus form a non-additive and non-commutative space. Sophisticated interpolation schemes are required that need to be tested not only for locking, spatial convergence behavior, and energy conservation, but also for observer invariance and path-independence. For the three novel beam element formulations all these properties are analytically and numerically studied and confirmed, if applicable. Two different rotation parameterization strategies are employed based on the well-known geodesic interpolation used in many Simo-Reissner beams and the lesser known split into the so-called smallest rotation and a torsional part. Application of the former parameterization results in a mixed finite element formulation intrinsically free of locking phenomena. Additionally, the first geometrically exact Kirchhoff-Love beam element is presented, which strongly enforces inextensibility by removing another degree of freedom. Furthermore, the numerical efficiency of the new beam formulations is compared to other beam elements that allow for or suppress shear deformation. When modeling very slender beams, the new elements offer distinct numerical advantages.","Cham : Springer International Publishing : Imprint: Springer, 2023.",English,,,"1 online resource (XXI, 134 p. 34 illus.) online resource.",File type: text fileFile format: PDF,,,DOI: 10.1007/978-3-031-06340-4,010853139,The novel finite element formulations fall into the category of geometrically exact Kirchhoff-Love beams.

An A-Z of Jane Austen - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Greaney, Michael","Jane Austen's richly textured worlds have enchanted readers for centuries and this neatly organised, playful book provides Austen enthusiasts and students alike with a unique insight into the much-loved writer's way with words. Using a lively A-Z structure, Greaney provides fresh angles on familiar Austen themes (D is for dance ; M is for matchmaking ), casts light on under-examined corners of her imagination (R is for risk ; S is for servant ), and shows how current social and cultural concerns are re-shaping our understanding of her work ( Q is for queer; W is for West Indies).

"Absolutely Indispensable Man : Ralph Bunche, the United Nations, and the Fight to End Empire - Duke University Libraries Catalog",,"Raustiala, Kal","A wide-ranging political biography of diplomat, Nobel prize winner, and civil rights leader Ralph Bunche.A legendary diplomat, scholar, and civil rights leader, Ralph Bunche was one of the most prominent Black Americans of the twentieth century. The first African American to obtain a political science Ph.D. from Harvard and a celebrated diplomat at the United Nations, he was once so famous he handedout the Best Picture award at the Oscars. Yet today Ralph Bunche is largely forgotten.In The Absolutely Indispensable Man, Kal Raustiala restores Bunche to his rightful place in history. He shows that Bunche was not only a singular figure in midcentury America; he was also one of the key architects of the postwar international order. Raustiala tells the story of Bunche's dramaticlife, from his early years in prewar Los Angeles to UCLA, Harvard, the State Department, and the heights of global diplomacy at the United Nations. After narrowly avoiding assassination Bunche received the Nobel Peace Prize for his ground-breaking mediation of the first Arab-Israeli conflict,catapulting him to popular fame. A central player in some of the most dramatic crises of the Cold War, he pioneered conflict management and peacekeeping at the UN. But as Raustiala argues, his most enduring achievement was his work to dismantle European empire. Bunche perceptively saw colonialism asthe central issue of the 20th century and decolonization as a project of global racial justice.From marching with Martin Luther King to advising presidents and prime ministers, Ralph Bunche shaped our world in lasting ways. This definitive biography gives him his due. It also reminds us that postwar decolonization not only fundamentally transformed world politics, but also powerfullyintersected with America's own civil rights struggle.","[Place of publication not identified] : Oxford University Press USA, 2023.",,,Title from content provider.,1 online resource,,,,,010758528,"The Absolutely Indispensable Man: Ralph Bunche, the United Nations, and the Fight to End Empire.

Accelerating Human Evolution by Theosophical Initiation - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,Mühlematter,"The main subjects of analysis in the present book are the stages of initiation in the grand scheme of Theosophical evolution. These initiatory steps are connected to an idea of evolutionary self-development by means of a set of virtues that are relative to the individual's position on the path of evolution. The central thesis is that these stages were translated from the ""Hindu"" tradition to the ""Theosophical"" tradition through multifaceted ""hybridization processes"" in which several Indian members of the Theosophical Society partook. Starting with Annie Besant's early Theosophy, the stages of initiation are traced through Blavatsky's work to Manilal Dvivedi and T. Subba Row, both Indian members of the Theosophical Society, and then on to the Sanâtana Dharma Text Books. In 1898, the English Theosophist Annie Besant and the Indian Theosophist Bhagavan Das together founded the Central Hindu College, Benares, which became the nucleus around which the Benares Hindu University was instituted in 1915. In this context the Sanâtana Dharma Text Books were published. Mühlematter shows that the stages of initiation were the blueprint for Annie Besant's pedagogy, which she implemented in the Central Hindu College in Benares. In doing so, he succeeds in making intelligible how ""esoteric"" knowledge was transferred to public institutions and how a broader public could be reached as a result.","[Place of publication not identified] : De Gruyter Oldenbourg, 2023.",,,Title from content provider.,1 online resource,,,,,010793457,"Main subjects of analysis are the stages of initiation in the grand scheme of Theosophical evolution.

Activist affordances : how disabled people improvise more habitable worlds - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Dokumacı, Arseli, 1981-","""Drawing on two visual ethnographies conducted in Turkey and Quebec, as well as autoethnographic materials, Activist Affordances unveils how disabled people imagine and bring into being more habitable worlds in the most micro of actions and the most fleeting of movements that Arseli Dokumaci calls ""activist affordances"". The book is full of visual sequences documenting these activist affordances: buttoning a shirt, peeling a potato, or prostrating for Namaz. Dokumaci argues that these improvised spaces of performance can enable survival in the least likely of circumstances by allowing their creators to make do with what they have. The social model of disability proposes that the built environment itself is what disables people: if we add curb cuts, corrective lenses, ramps, elevators, and ASL interpretation, access improves and people are no longer disabled. Yet this model is at odds with the experiences of those living with chronic diseases like chronic pain, depression, fatigue, and cancer, who experience what Arseli Dokumacı calls ""shrinkage"": a narrowing relation of body and environment that results in constraints, failures, and losses.

Nanophysics and plasmas are synergic physical areas where the whole is more than the sum of the parts (quantum, atomic and molecular, electrodynamics, photonics, condensed matter, thermodynamics, transport phenomena). The authors emphasize both fundamentals and more complex concepts, making the contents accessible as well challenging. Nanoscale properties and physical phenomena are explained under the umbrella of quantum physics. Advances made in the physical knowledge of the nanoworld, and its metrology are addressed, along with experimental achievements which have furthered studies of extreme weak forces present at nano- or sub-micron scales. The book does not focus in detail on the diversity of applications in nanotechnology and instrumentation, considering that the reader already has basic prior knowledge on that. It also covers an introduction to plasma universe phenomenology, the basics of advanced mathematics applied to the electromagnetic field, longitudinal forces in the vacuum, concepts of helicity and topological torsion, SU(2) representation of Maxwell equations, 2D representation of the electromagnetic field, the use of the fractional derivative, and ergontropic dynamics. The chapters include theory, applications, bibliographic references, and solved exercises.

Advances in cyber security and intelligent analytics - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Verma, Abhishek","We live in a digital world, where we use digital tools and smart devices to communicate over the Internet. In turn, an enormous amount of data gets generated. The traditional computing architectures are inefficient in storing and managing this massive amount of data. Unfortunately, the data cannot be ignored as it helps businesses to make better decisions, solve problems, understand performance, improve processes, and understand customers. Therefore, we need modern systems capable of handling and managing data efficiently. In the past few decades, many distributed computing paradigms have emerged, and we have noticed a substantial growth in the applications based on such emerging paradigms. Some well-known emerging computing paradigms include cloud computing, fog computing, and edge computing, which have leveraged the increase in the volume of data being generated every second. However, the distributed computing paradigms face critical challenges, including network management and cyber security. We have witnessed the development of various networking models--IoT, SDN, and ICN--to support modern systems requirements. However, they are undergoing rapid changes and need special attention. The main issue faced by these paradigms is that traditional solutions cannot be directly applied to address the challenges. Therefore, there is a significant need to develop improved network management and cyber security solutions. To this end, this book highlights the challenges faced by emerging paradigms and presents the recent developments made to address the challenges. More specifically, it presents a detailed study on security issues in distributed computing environments and their possible solutions, followed by applications of medical IoT, deep learning, IoV, healthcare, etc.","Boca Raton : CRC Press, 2023.",English,,Description based on print version record.Includes bibliographical references and index.,1 online resource (pages cm),File type: text file,,,LCCN: 2022033769,010752201,"We live in a digital world, where we use digital tools and smart devices to communicate over the Internet.

It includes advances in physical modelling, monitoring techniques, data acquisition and analysis, and provides an invaluable contribution for the installation of new civil engineering experimental facilities. The first part of the book covers the latest advances in testing and experimentation in key domains of geotechnics: soil mechanics and geotechnical engineering, rock mechanics and rock engineering, and engineering geology. Some of the topics covered include new developments in topographic survey acquisition for applied mapping and in situ geotechnical investigations; laboratory and in situ tests to estimate the relevant parameters needed to model the behaviour of rock masses and land structures; monitoring and inspection techniques designed for offshore wind foundations. The second part of the book highlights the relevance of testing and monitoring in transportation. Full-scale accelerated pavement testing, and instrumentation becomes even more important nowadays when, for sustainability purposes, non-traditional materials are used in road and airfield pavements. Innovation in testing and monitoring pavements and railway tracks is also developed in this part of the book. Intelligent traffic systems are the new traffic management paradigm, and an overview of new solutions is addressed here. Finally, in the third part of the book, trends in the field and laboratory measurements and corresponding data analysis are presented according to the different hydraulic domains addressed in this publication, namely maritime hydraulics, surface water and river hydraulics and urban water. .","Cham : Springer International Publishing : Imprint: Springer, 2023.",English,,,"1 online resource (XIX, 375 p. 196 illus., 178 illus. in color.) online resource.",File type: text fileFile format: PDF,,,DOI: 10.1007/978-3-031-05875-2,010853238,"Advances on Testing and Experimentation in Civil Engineering : Geotechnics, Transportation, Hydraulics and Natural Resources - Duke University Libraries Catalog.

Aeroplane and the Making of Modern India - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Iqbal, Aashique Ahmed","From airports crowded with refugees desperate to flee Partition violence to the mountainous battlefields of Kashmir, aircraft proved indispensable to newly independent India. The aeroplane played a small but significant role in India's transformation from a British colony to an independent republic. Through the prism of aviation, both civil and military, 'The Aeroplane and the Making of Modern India' charts India's journey from the Second World War to the nationalization of Indian airline companies in 1953. For independent India, the aeroplane represented not only a powerful means of projecting state power but also a symbol of what it meant to be modern. This was not lost on other contenders for sovereignty in South Asia. Both Pakistan and the Indian princes also invested extensively in aviation in the hopes of bolstering their power and legitimacy in South Asia. Drawing on numerous archives, untapped personal collections, and newspaper reports in India and the United Kingdom, Aashique Iqbal provides the first comprehensive history of the Indian state's engagement with aviation.

"The aesthetic life of infrastructure : race, affect, environment - Duke University Libraries Catalog",,"Rich, Kelly M.","A critical reading of the unstable structures that organize biological and social life     This timely and radically interdisciplinary volume uncovers the aesthetics and politics of infrastructure. From roads and bridges to harbors and canals, infrastructure is conventionally understood as the public works that allow for the circulation of capital. Yet this naturalized concept of infrastructure, driven by capital's restless expansion, is haunted by imperial tendencies to occupy territory, extract resources, and organize life. Infrastructure thus undergirds the living nexus of modernity in an ongoing project of racialization, affective embodiment, and environmental praxis. Rather than merely making visible infrastructure's modes of power, however, The Aesthetic Life of Infrastructure brings literary methods to bear on the interpretive terrain, reading infrastructural space and temporalities to show that their aesthetic and sensorial experience cannot be understood apart from histories of production and political economies.    Building on critical infrastructure studies in anthropology, geography, and media studies, this collection demonstrates the field's vitality to scholars working across the humanities, including in literary, visual, and cultural studies. By querying the presumed invisibility of infrastructure's hidden life, the volume's contributors revitalize ongoing literary debates about reading surface and depth.

"Affirmative action for economically weaker sections and upper-castes in Indian constitutional law : context, judicial discourse, and critique - Duke University Libraries Catalog",,"Wankhede, Asang","This book examines the controversial 103rd Constitutional Amendment to the Indian Constitution that introduced an income and asset ownership-based new constitutional standard for determining backwardness marking a significant shift in the government's social and public policy.

It provides an analytical and descriptive account of the proliferation of reservation policy in India and critiques these interventions to assess their implication on constitutional jurisprudence. Further, it assesses the theoretical and empirical challenges such developments pose to the principle of substantive equality and scope of affirmative action policies in Indian constitutional law and general discrimination law theory.

It examines the translocal actors, networks, and media which constructed a 'Spiritscape' of charismatic renewal in the Anglo-world contexts of Australia, the British Isles, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa, and the United States. It places this arena also in a wider and dynamic worldwide setting, exploring the ways in which charismatic imaginations of an 'age of the Spirit' were shaped by interpenetrations with the 'Third World', the Soviet Bloc, and beyond in the global Sixties and Seventies.

Algorithms for the People : Democracy in the Age of AI - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Simons, Josh","How to put democracy at the heart of AI governance   Artificial intelligence and machine learning are reshaping our world. Police forces use them to decide where to send police officers, judges to decide whom to release on bail, welfare agencies to decide which children are at risk of abuse, and Facebook and Google to rank content and distribute ads. In these spheres, and many others, powerful prediction tools are changing how decisions are made, narrowing opportunities for the exercise of judgment, empathy, and creativity. In Algorithms for the People , Josh Simons flips the narrative about how we govern these technologies. Instead of examining the impact of technology on democracy, he explores how to put democracy at the heart of AI governance.  Drawing on his experience as a research fellow at Harvard University, a visiting research scientist on Facebook's Responsible AI team, and a policy advisor to the UK's Labour Party, Simons gets under the hood of predictive technologies, offering an accessible account of how they work, why they matter, and how to regulate the institutions that build and use them.  He argues that prediction is political: human choices about how to design and use predictive tools shape their effects. Approaching predictive technologies through the lens of political theory casts new light on how democracies should govern political choices made outside the sphere of representative politics. Showing the connection between technology regulation and democratic reform, Simons argues that we must go beyond conventional theorizing of AI ethics to wrestle with fundamental moral and political questions about how the governance of technology can support the flourishing of democracy.","Princeton, NJ : Princeton University Press, [2023]©2023",English,,Includes bibliographical references and index.In English.,1 online resource ( 320 p.) : illustrations.,File type: text fileFile format: PDF,,,DOI: 10.1515/9780691244914,010763418,"Algorithms for the People: Democracy in the Age of AI - Duke University Libraries Catalog.

ALL THE BEAUTY IN THE WORLD : THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART AND ME. - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"BRINGLEY, PATRICK","A fascinating, revelatory portrait of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and its treasures by a former New Yorker staffer who spent a decade as a museum guard.   Millions of people climb the grand marble staircase to visit the Metropolitan Museum of Art every year. But only a select few have unrestricted access to every nook and cranny. They're the guards who roam unobtrusively in dark blue suits, keeping a watchful eye on the two million square foot treasure house. Caught up in his glamorous fledgling career at The New Yorker , Patrick Bringley never thought he'd be one of them. Then his older brother was diagnosed with fatal cancer and he found himself needing to escape the mundane clamor of daily life. So he quit The New Yorker and sought solace in the most beautiful place he knew.  To his surprise and the reader's delight, this temporary refuge becomes Bringley's home away from home for a decade. We follow him as he guards delicate treasures from Egypt to Rome, strolls the labyrinths beneath the galleries, wears out nine pairs of company shoes, and marvels at the beautiful works in his care. Bringley enters the museum as a ghost, silent and almost invisible, but soon finds his voice and his tribe: the artworks and their creators and the lively subculture of museum guards--a gorgeous mosaic of artists, musicians, blue-collar stalwarts, immigrants, cutups, and dreamers. As his bonds with his colleagues and the art grow, he comes to understand how fortunate he is to be walled off in this little world, and how much it resembles the best aspects of the larger world to which he gradually, gratefully returns.

"Allergic intimacies : food, disability, desire, and risk - Duke University Libraries Catalog",,"Gill, Michael Carl","The first book to explore food allergies in the United States from the perspective of disability and race   Are food allergies disabilities? What structures and systems ensure the survival of some with food allergies and not others? Allergic Intimacies is a groundbreaking critical engagement with food allergies in their cultural representations, advocacy, law, and stories about personal experiences from a disability studies perspective. Author Michael Gill questions the predominantly individualized medical approaches to food allergies, pointing out that these approaches are particularly problematic where allergy testing and treatments are expensive, inconsistent, and inaccessible for many people of color.  This thought-provoking book explores the multiple meanings of food allergies and eating in the United States, demonstrating how much more is at stake than we realize, at a critical time when food allergies are on the rise: An estimated 32 million Americans, including one in thirteen children, have food allergies. Diagnoses of food allergies in children have increased by 50 percent since 1997. Yet as the author makes clear, the whiteness of the food allergy community and single-identity disability theory is inherently limiting and insufficient to address the complex choices that those with food allergies make. Gill argues that racism and ableism create unique precarity for disabled people of color that food allergic communities are only beginning to address. There is a huge disparity in access to testing and treatment, with African American and Latinx children having higher risk of adverse outcomes than white children, including more rates of anaphylaxis. Food allergy professionals have a responsibility to move beyond individualized approaches to more robust coalitional efforts grounded in disability and racial justice to undo these patterns of exclusion.  Allergic Intimacies celebrates the various creative ways food allergic communities are challenging historical and current practice of exclusion, while identifying the depth of work that still needs to be done to shift focus from a white allergic experience toward a more representative understanding of the racial, ethnic, religious, and economic diversity of those in the United States. Gill's book is a discerning and vital exploration of the key debates about risks, dangers, safety, representations, and political concerns affecting the lives of individuals with food allergies.","New York : Fordham University Press, 2023.",English,,Includes bibliographical references and index.,1 online resource (160 pages) : 160 pages : illustrations (black and white.,,,,,010791310,"Allergic Intimacies is the first book to explore food allergies in the United States from the perspective of disability and race.

"Allied air attacks and civilian harm in Italy, 1940-1945 : bombing among friends - Duke University Libraries Catalog",,"Evangelista, Matthew, 1958-","Tens of thousands of Italian civilians perished in the Allied bombing raids of World War II. More of them died after the Armistice of September 1943 than before, when the air attacks were intended to induce Italy's surrender. Allied Air Attacks and Civilian Harm in Italy, 1940-1945 addresses this seeming paradox, by examining the views of Allied political and military leaders, Allied air crews, and Italians on the ground. It tells the stories of a little-known diplomat (Myron Charles Taylor), military strategist (Solly Zuckerman), resistance fighter (Aldo Quaranta), and peace activist (Vera Brittain) - architects and opponents of the bombing strategies. It describes the fate of ordinary civilians, drawing on a wealth of local and digital archival sources, memoir accounts, novels, and films, including Joseph Heller's Catch-22 and John Huston's The Battle of San Pietro .The book will be of interest to readers concerned about the ethical, legal, and human dimensions of bombing and its effects on civilians, to students of military strategy and Italian history, and to World War II buffs.

"The American stamp : postal iconography, democratic citizenship, and consumerism in the United States - Duke University Libraries Catalog",,"Goldblatt, Laura","More than three thousand different images appeared on United States postage stamps from the middle of the nineteenth century to the end of the twentieth. Limited at first to the depiction of a small cast of characters and patriotic images, postal iconography gradually expanded as the Postal Service sought to depict the country and its history in all its diversity. This vast breadth has helped make stamp collecting a widespread hobby and led many people to see stamps as consumer goods in their own right.  Examining the canon of nineteenth- and twentieth-century American stamps, Laura Goldblatt and Richard Handler show how postal iconography and material culture offer a window into the contested meanings and responsibilities of U.S. citizenship. They argue that postage stamps, which are both devices to pay for a government service and purchasable items themselves, embody a crucial tension: is democracy defined by political agency or the freedom to buy? The changing images and uses of stamps reveal how governmental authorities have attempted to navigate between public service and businesslike efficiency, belonging and exclusion, citizenship and consumerism. Stamps are vehicles for state messaging, and what they depict is tied up with broader questions of what it means to be American.  Goldblatt and Handler combine historical, sociological, and iconographic analysis of a vast quantity of stamps with anthropological exploration of how postal customers and stamp collectors behave. At the crossroads of several disciplines, this book casts the symbolic and material meanings of stamps in a wholly new light.","New York : Columbia University Press, [2023]",English,,Includes bibliographical references and index.,"xi, 349 pages, 12 unnumbered pages of plates : illustrations (some color) ; 24 cm",,,1310467981.0,LCCN: 2022015218^^,010792861,"The American stamp : postal iconography, democratic citizenship, and consumerism in the United States - Duke University Libraries Catalog.

Analysis and Comparison of Metaheuristics - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Cuevas, Erik","This book presents a comparative perspective of current metaheuristic developments, which have proved to be effective in their application to several complex problems. The study of biological and social entities such as animals, humans, or insects that manifest a cooperative behavior has produced several computational models in metaheuristic methods. Although these schemes emulate very different processes or systems, the rules used to model individual behavior are very similar. Under such conditions, it is not clear to identify which are the advantages or disadvantages of each metaheuristic technique. The book is compiled from a teaching perspective. For this reason, the book is primarily intended for undergraduate and postgraduate students of Science, Electrical Engineering, or Computational Mathematics. It is appropriate for courses such as Artificial Intelligence, Electrical Engineering, Evolutionary Computation. The book is also useful for researchers from the evolutionary and engineering communities.

Anselm : A Very Short Introduction - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,Williams,"Anselm of Canterbury (1033-1109) was the outstanding philosopher-theologian of the Latin West between Augustine and the thirteenth century. As a public figure, especially as Archbishop of Canterbury, he corresponded with kings and nobles, popes and bishops, in letters that reveal a fascinating personality and flesh out the practical dimensions of his theoretical philosophy. He wrote at a time when a renewed interest in logic encouraged careful and rigorous argumentation, but before the recovery of Aristotle filled the philosophical discourse with difficult technical jargon, making for writing that is unrivalled for its lucidity and accessibility. He offers the first clear account of what we now call a libertarian view of free will, according to which free choices cannot be determined by the agent's internal states or by external influences. His famous 'ontological argument' for the existence of God continues to generate discussion, debate, and puzzlement. His understanding of God is rightly regarded as one of the definitive expressions of classical theism or perfect-being theology, which remains influential in philosophy of religion and analytic theology. His account of the Atonement is one that every theologian to this day still grapples with.

Anti-Colonialism and the Crises of Interwar Fascism - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Ortiz, Michael","What is fascism? Is it an anomaly in the history of modern Europe? Or its culmination? In Anti-Colonialism and the Crises of Interwar Fascism , Michael Ortiz makes the case that fascism should be understood, in part, as an imperial phenomenon. He contends that the Age of Appeasement (1935-1939) was not a titanic clash between rival socio-political systems (fascism and democracy), but rather an imperial contest between satisfied and unsatisfied empires.Historians have long debated the extent to which Western imperialisms served as ideological and intellectual precursors to European fascisms. To date, this scholarship has largely employed an ""inside-out"" methodology that examines the imperial discourses that pushed fascist regimes outward, into Africa, Asia, and the Americas. While effective, such approaches tend to ignore the ways in which these places and their inhabitants understood European fascisms. Addressing this imbalance, Anti-Colonialism adopts an ""outside-in"" approach that analyses fascist expansion from the perspective of Indian anti-colonialists such as Jawaharlal Nehru, Subhas Bose, and Mohandas Gandhi. Seen from India, the crises of Interwar fascism--the Second Italo-Ethiopian War, Spanish Civil War, Second Sino-Japanese War, Munich Agreement, and the outbreak of the Second World War--were yet another eruption of imperial expansion analogous (although not identical) to the Scramble for Africa and the Treaty of Versailles. Whether fascist, democratic, or imperialist, Europe's great powers collectively negotiated the fate of smaller nations.","London ; New York, NY : Bloomsbury Academic, Bloomsbury Publishing, 2023.",English,,Includes bibliographical references and index.,264 pages 264 pages : illustrations (black and white) ; 24 cm,,History,1345220965.0,British national bibliography: GBC2M3224,010858750,"Michael Ortiz makes the case that fascism should be understood, in part, as an imperial phenomenon.

Antitrust policy in health care markets - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Blair, Roger D.","Health care costs in the United States are much higher than in other countries. These cost differences can be explained in part by a lack of competition in the United States. Some markets, such as pharmaceuticals and medical equipment, have elements of monopoly. Other markets, such as health insurance, have elements of monopsony. Many other markets may be subject to collusion on prices, such as generic drugs, or wages, such as the nurse labor market. Lawful monopoly and monopsony are beyond the reach of antitrust laws, but collusion is not. When appropriate, vigorous antitrust enforcement challenging anticompetitive conduct can aid in reducing health care costs.

Applied corporate risk and liquidity management - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Lie, Erik","Cash holdings play a critical role for all corporations. They serve as a source of funding for investment projects that create value for shareholders and as a cushion against costly financial distress. On the other hand, excess cash holdings can induce wasteful spending and attract unwantedattention from labor unions and activist investors.In Applied Corporate Risk and Liquidity Management, Erik Lie brings risk management and liquidity management together to explore how corporations can ensure they have sufficient--but not excess--cash holdings, both now and in the future. He begins by covering the determinants of liquidity, theconsequences of suboptimal liquidity, and how to manage liquidity. Lie then demonstrates two ways to control current and future cash holdings: the mitigation of risk factors on operating cash flow and cash holdings and the payouts made to investors. Through this integrated approach, he explores howrisk management and payout policy can and should be used to maintain the proper cash level.

"ARAB-ISRAELI WAR OF ATTRITION, 1967-1973; V. 1 : AFTERMATH OF THE SIX-DAY WAR, RENEWED COMBAT, WEST B. - Duke University Libraries Catalog",,"NORTON, BILL, 1959-","This book details the period of the Arab-Israeli conflict between the June 1967 and October 1973 wars, referred to as the War of Attrition.   The Arab-Israeli conflict persisted through two wars and ongoing border tensions. However, the Six-Day War of June 1967 was a cataclysm. Israel emerged victorious in a war with neighboring Arab states and in possession of occupied territory. The Arabs were furious at this outcome and determined to regain their lands and dignity by again making war with Israel. Added to the mix was a resurgent Palestinian liberation movement. Renewed fighting began within weeks. It became a period of sustained combat, casualties, fiscal outlay, and diplomacy on the world stage unlike anything experienced previously. All involved militaries remained very active over these years with more consistent mobilization, intensive training, and action than ever before. Each side deepened their dependence on superpower arms supply. The geopolitical stakes rose and Israel found itself fighting the Soviets indirectly on the borders and terrorist internationally. Adversary forces grew in size, adopted more complex weapons, and trained in new tactics, all in the tumult of combat of escalating intensity. The danger of this sparking another general war with potential superpower involvement was high. This period is collectively referred to as the War of Attrition.The named War of Attrition on the Suez Canal was began on March 8, 1969, and ended with a ceasefire 17 months later. However, there was combat on all fronts before and after. Palestinian irregulars operating from Jordan brought Israeli counter-insurgency operations in the West Bank and Jordan. Israeli special operations and bombing inside Jordan sought to compel that government to reign in the guerrillas and this greatly threatened the economy. The Palestinian elements challenged the Jordanian government itself and a civil war erupted that saw a dramatic decline in the power of the irregulars. Moving their principal base of operations to Lebanon saw the same cycle began evolving there. Syria struggled to regain strength to take on Israel again. They eventually began periodic operations against Israeli forces on the Golan Heights as retribution and to build strength for the next war many saw as inevitable.The air forces of especially Israel and Egypt, then Syria, became especially active, grew in size and capabilities. They employed some of the most advanced weapons the USA and the USSR arrayed in their Cold War confrontation. The extent of the air war grew to extensive air defenses and long-range bombing plus deep photo reconnaissance.It was an extraordinary time of confrontation, irregular warfare, rising terrorism, and national struggles seldom seen before or since. It became the world's most violent, costly, and dangerous conflict after that in Southeast Asia. At the center of it, Israel found herself engaged on all sides and isolated as never before. The struggle altered the geopolitical landscape and set the stage for the October 1973 war.Volume 1 of this series covers the immediate aftermath of the Six-Day War as forces were reconstituted, strategies formulated and combat began anew on the new borders. The air forces and associated weapons that would play a significant role in the coming years are detailed.",WARWICK HELION AND COMPANY 2023.,,,,,,,,,010791392,"This book details the period of the Arab-Israeli conflict between the June 1967 and October 1973 wars, referred to as the War of Attrition.

Are Books Still 'Different'? : Literature as Culture and Commodity in a Digital Age - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,Koegler,"The famous 1962 precedent at the Restrictive Practices Court of the United Kingdom, 'Books are different,' is still the reasoning behind many cultural policies around the world, building on longstanding assumptions surrounding 'the book'. As this suggests, the 'difference' of the book as a unique form of cultural (rather than economic) production has acquired a powerful status. But are books still different? In (somewhat provocatively) asking this question from a network-oriented and interdisciplinary perspective (book studies/literary studies), this Element inquires into the notion of 'difference' in relation to books. Challenging common notions of 'bibliodiversity,' it reconsiders the lack of diversity in the publishing industry. It also engages with the diversifying potentials of the digital literary sphere, offering a case study of Bernardine Evaristo's industry activities and activism, the Element concludes with thoughts on bookishness, affect and networked practice.

"Arendt, Kant, and the enigma of judgment - Duke University Libraries Catalog",,"Blumenthal-Barby, Martin","A nuanced extrapolation of Hannah Arendt's theory of judgment through her highly provocative reading of Immanuel Kant     More than a half century after it was first published, Hannah Arendt's Origins of Totalitarianism rose to the top of best-seller lists as readers grappled with the triumph of Trumpism. Arendt, Kant, and the Enigma of Judgment directs our attention to her later thought, the posthumously published and highly provocative Lectures on Kant's Political Philosophy . Martin Blumenthal-Barby puts this work in dialogue with Arendt's other writings, including her notes on Kant's Critique of Judgment , to outline her own theory of judgment for the twentieth century. In an era of post-truths and artificial intelligence, the idea that authentic judgment--for example, the ability to distinguish right from wrong--is incommensurable with abstract, automated processes lies at the center of Arendt's late work and at the fore of our collective reckoning.    Rather than presenting us with a fixed account, Blumenthal-Barby suggests, Arendt's drawing and redrawing of conceptual distinctions is itself an enactment of judgment, a process that challenges and complicates what she says at every turn. In so doing, Arendt, in thoroughly Kantian fashion, establishes judgment as a performative category that can never be taught but only demonstrated.

Artificial intelligence perspective for smart cities - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Kahyaoglu, Sezer Bozkus","The concept of a ""smart city"" is used widely in general; however, it is hard to explain because of the complexity and multidimensionality of this notion. However, the essential qualification for being a smart city is to achieve ""sustainable social, environmental, and economic development"" and boost the living standards of society based on Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and Artificial intelligence (AI). AI in smart cities has become an important aspect for cities that face great challenges to make smart decisions for social well-being, particularly cybersecurity and corporate sustainability. In this context, we aim to contribute literature with a value-added approach where various AI applications of smart cities are discussed from a different perspective. First, we start by discussing the conceptual design, modeling, and determination of components for the sustainability of a smart city structure. Since smart cities operate on spatial-based data, it is important to design, operate, and manage smart city elements using Geographical Information Systems (GIS) technologies. Second, we define the structure, type, unit, and functionality of the layers to be placed on the GIS to achieve best practices based on Industry 4.0 components. Transportation is one of the key indicators of smart cities, so it is critical to make transportation in smart cities accessible for different disabled groups by using AI technologies. Third, we demonstrate what kinds of technologies should be used for which disabled groups in different transportation vehicles with specific examples. Finally, we create a discussion platform for processes and sub-processes such as waste management, emergency management, risk management, and data management for establishing smart cities including the financial and ethical aspects.","Boca Raton : CRC Press, 2023.",English,,Includes bibliographical references.,1 online resource (1 online resource),File type: text file,,,LCCN: 2022024500,010742222,"The concept of a ""smart city"" is hard to explain because of the complexity and multidimensionality of this notion.

The artist in the counterculture : Bruce Conner to Mike Kelley and other tales from the edge - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Crow, Thomas E., 1948-","How California's counterculture of the 1960s to 1980s profoundly shaped--and was shaped by--West Coast artists   The 1960s exert a special fascination in modern art. But most accounts miss the defining impact of the period's youth culture, largely incubated in California, on artists who came of age in that decade. As their prime exemplar, Bruce Conner, reminisced, ""I did everything that everybody did in 1967 in the Haight-Ashbury. . . . I would take peyote and walk out in the streets."" And he vividly channeled those experiences into his art, while making his mark on every facet of the psychedelic movement--from the mountains of Mexico with Timothy Leary to the rock ballrooms of San Francisco to the gilded excesses of the New Hollywood. In The Artist in the Counterculture , Thomas Crow tells the story of California art from the 1960s to the 1980s--some of the strongest being made anywhere at the time--and why it cannot be understood apart from the new possibilities of thinking and feeling unleashed by the rebels of the counterculture.  Crow reevaluates Conner and other key figures--from Catholic activist Corita Kent to Black Panther Emory Douglas to ecological witness Bonnie Ora Sherk--as part of a generational cohort galvanized by resistance to war, racial oppression, and environmental degradation.

Asian Perceptions of Gulf Security - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Sim, Li-Chen","Gulf stability is coming to play a larger role in the foreign policy calculus of many states, but the evolving role of Asian powers is largely under-represented in the International Relations literature. This volume addresses this gap with a set of empirically rich, theory driven case studies written by academics from or based in the countries in question. The underlying assumption is not that Asian powers have already become important security actors in the Gulf, but rather that they perceive the Gulf as a region of increasing strategic relevance. How will leaders in these countries adjust to an evolving regional framework? Will there be coordinated efforts to establish an Asian-centered approach to Gulf stability, or will Asian rivalries make the region a theatre of competition? Will US-China tensions force alignment choices among Asian powers? Will Asian states balance, bandwagon, hedge, or adopt some other approach to their Gulf relationships? These questions become even more important as the western boundaries of Asia increasingly come to incorporate the Middle East. The book will appeal to scholars and students in the fields of International Relations, Security Studies, and International Political Economy, as well as area specialists on the Gulf and those working on foreign policy issues on each of the Asian countries included.

"Atrocity crimes and international law : responsibility to protect, intercession, and non-forceful responses - Duke University Libraries Catalog",,"Henderson, Stacey (Stacey Lee)","Despite repeated declarations of 'never again' in response to the commission of atrocities, civilians have continued to be targeted by their leaders and opposition groups. The international law principles of sovereignty and non-intervention, when taken at their highest, require States to stand idle and not intervene in another State regardless of what atrocities may be occurring there. This traditional legal view is being challenged by an emerging practice of States choosing to respond in non-forceful ways, inspired by the concept of the Responsibility to Protect (R2P). Drawing on R2P, this book introduces and develops an original conceptual tool -intercession -to capture and explain this change in State practice and the impact of R2P on the development of international law. Through a close examination of State practice, the work explores whether there has been an expansion in the permissible measures and situations in which States can intervene, without using force, in response to atrocity crimes occurring in other States. This book concludes that the development of the secondary duty on the international community under R2P provides the greatest opportunity to progress the R2P framework in a meaningful way, which will have a significant impact on the protection of populations from atrocity crimes.

Autophagy in Stem Cell Maintenance and Differentiation - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Shravage, Bhupendra V.","This book covers a wide range of topics that illustrate the various functions of autophagy in stem cells and offers insights on the mechanisms by which autophagy can regulate stem-cell self-renewal and facilitate specific differentiation programs.

They have two unique properties: the ability to self-renew and the ability to differentiate into one or more cell types. These characteristics of stem cells have found immense therapeutic potential in regenerative medicine. Autophagy is a crucial membrane trafficking pathway that is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis that involves sequestration of non-functional proteins, protein aggregates and damaged organelles in double-membraned vesicles called autophagosomes, which are subsequently targeted to the lysosome for degradation. The primary aim of this book is to provide knowledge of recent developments in our understanding of the role of autophagy in stem cells, including germline stem cells.

Axiomatics : mathematical thought and high modernism - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Steingart, Alma","The first history of postwar mathematics, offering a new interpretation of the rise of abstraction and axiomatics in the twentieth century.     Why did abstraction dominate American art, social science, and natural science in the mid-twentieth century? Why, despite opposition, did abstraction and theoretical knowledge flourish across a diverse set of intellectual pursuits during the Cold War? In recovering the centrality of abstraction across a range of modernist projects in the United States, Alma Steingart brings mathematics back into the conversation about midcentury American intellectual thought. The expansion of mathematics in the aftermath of World War II, she demonstrates, was characterized by two opposing tendencies: research in pure mathematics became increasingly abstract and rarified, while research in applied mathematics and mathematical applications grew in prominence as new fields like operations research and game theory brought mathematical knowledge to bear on more domains of knowledge. Both were predicated on the same abstractionist conception of mathematics and were rooted in the same approach: modern axiomatics.     For American mathematicians, the humanities and the sciences did not compete with one another, but instead were two complementary sides of the same epistemological commitment. Steingart further reveals how this mathematical epistemology influenced the sciences and humanities, particularly the postwar social sciences. As mathematics changed, so did the meaning of mathematization.     Axiomatics focuses on American mathematicians during a transformative time, following a series of controversies among mathematicians about the nature of mathematics as a field of study and as a body of knowledge. The ensuing debates offer a window onto the postwar development of mathematics band Cold War epistemology writ large. As Steingart's history ably demonstrates, mathematics is the social activity in which styles of truth--here, abstraction--become synonymous with ways of knowing.","Chicago, IL : The University of Chicago Press, 2023.©2023",English,,Includes bibliographical references and index.,291 pages : illustrations ; 23 cm,,History,1304363252.0,LCCN: 2022026640British national bibliography: GBC2J9355,010850683,"The first history of postwar mathematics, offering a new interpretation of the rise of abstraction and axiomatics in the twentieth century.

For American mathematicians, the humanities and the sciences did not compete with one another, but instead were two complementary sides of the same epistemological commitment.","Why did abstraction dominate American art, social science, and natural science in the mid-twentieth century? As Steingart's history ably demonstrates, mathematics is the social activity in which styles of truth--here, abstraction--become synonymous with ways of knowing. In recovering the centrality of abstraction across a range of modernist projects in the United States, Alma Steingart brings mathematics back into the conversation about midcentury American intellectual thought. Steingart further reveals how this mathematical epistemology influenced the sciences and humanities, particularly the postwar social sciences. Axiomatics : mathematical thought and high modernism - Duke University Libraries Catalog The first history of postwar mathematics, offering a new interpretation of the rise of abstraction and axiomatics in the twentieth century."
Bad Cree : A Novel. - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Johns, Jessica","In this gripping, horror-laced debut, a young Cree woman's dreams lead her on a perilous journey of self-discovery that ultimately forces her to confront the toll of a legacy of violence on her family, her community and the land they call home.  ""A mystery and a horror story about grief, but one with defiant hope in its beating heart."" --Paul Tremblay, author of A Head Full of Ghosts and The Pallbearers Club   When Mackenzie wakes up with a severed crow's head in her hands, she panics. Only moments earlier she had been fending off masses of birds in a snow-covered forest. In bed, when she blinks, the head disappears.   Night after night, Mackenzie's dreams return her to a memory from before her sister Sabrina's untimely death: a weekend at the family's lakefront campsite, long obscured by a fog of guilt. But when the waking world starts closing in, too--a murder of crows stalks her every move around the city, she wakes up from a dream of drowning throwing up water, and gets threatening text messages from someone claiming to be Sabrina--Mackenzie knows this is more than she can handle alone.  Traveling north to her rural hometown in Alberta, she finds her family still steeped in the same grief that she ran away to Vancouver to escape. They welcome her back, but their shaky reunion only seems to intensify her dreams--and make them more dangerous.

Ballad hunting with Max Hunter : stories of an Ozark folksong collector - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Nelson, Sarah Jane, 1959-","A traveling salesman with little formal education, Max Hunter gravitated to song catching and ballad hunting while on business trips in the Ozarks. Hunter recorded nearly 1600 traditional songs by more than 200 singers from the mid-1950s through the mid-1970s, all the while focused on preserving the music in its unaltered form. Sarah Jane Nelson chronicles Hunter's song collecting adventures alongside portraits of the singers and mentors he met along the way. The guitar-strumming Hunter picked up the recording habit to expand his repertoire but almost immediately embraced the role of song preservationist. Being a local allowed Hunter to merge his native Ozark earthiness with sharp observational skills to connect--often more than once--with his singers. Hunter's own ability to be present added to that sense of connection. Despite his painstaking approach, ballad collecting was also a source of pleasure for Hunter. Ultimately, his dedication to capturing Ozarks song culture in its natural state brought Hunter into contact with people like Vance Randolph, Mary Parler, and non-academic folklorists who shared his values.

Becoming a parent : contemporary contexts and challenges during the transition to parenthood - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"McMahon, Catherine A.","The contexts for becoming a parent are ever-changing, bringing new opportunities and new challenges. Becoming a Parent examines the transition to parenthood from diverse perspectives - it is about becoming, rather than being a parent. Drawing on a large body of theory and research, the book explores universal psychological journeys as well as the specific challenges faced by those whose pathways to parenthood are non-traditional or medically complicated. It also examines the unprecedented reproductive choices in contemporary society and provides a comprehensive overview of the personal and social impact of reproductive technologies. Pregnancy, childbirth, and early parenthood (the so-called 'fourth trimester') are discussed in detail and illustrated with case anecdotes and personal stories of people with 'high-risk' pregnancies, fathers as well as mothers, adoptive parents, and LGBTQ as well as heterosexual adults.

BECOMING A SCHOLARLY JOURNAL EDITOR : PRACTICAL ADVICE FOR EDITORS AND TIPS FOR AUTHORS. - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Journell, Wayne","Along with the infamous ""Reviewer 2,"" journal editors are a leading cause of angst among scholars. When editors are bad at their jobs, careers are damaged, reputations of journals suffer, and the overall scholarship within a field is weakened. Yet, despite their importance to the practice of academia, most editors do not receive any formal training on the editing process. Even well-published authors face a steep learning curve when navigating all of the moving parts of a scholarly journal and providing quality feedback to authors. This book is intended to be a guide for scholarly journal editors. It walks current and prospective editors through the various steps of the editing process, including establishing an editorial vision, creating editorial teams/boards, interpreting reviewers' comments and writing decision letters, and publicizing published articles and improving journal metrics.

McMillan Prize in Southern History   Brooke M. Bauer's Becoming Catawba: Catawba Indian Women and Nation-Building, 1540-1840 is the first book-length study of the role Catawba women played in creating and preserving a cohesive tribal identity over three centuries of colonization and cultural turmoil. Bauer, a citizen of the Catawba Indian Nation of South Carolina, weaves ethnohistorical methodologies, family history, cultural context, and the Catawba language together to generate an internal perspective on the Catawbas' history and heritage in the area now known as the Carolina Piedmont.  This unique and important study examines the lives and legacies of women who executed complex decision-making and diplomacy to navigate shifting frameworks of kinship, land ownership, and cultural production in dealings with colonial encroachments, white settlers, and Euro-American legal systems and governments from the mid-sixteenth century to the early nineteenth century. Personified in the figure of Sally New River, a Catawba cultural leader to whom 500 remaining acres of occupied tribal lands were deeded on behalf of the community in 1796 and which she managed until her death in 1821, Bauer reveals how women worked to ensure the survival of the Catawba people and their Catawba identity, an effort that resulted in a unified nation.  Bauer's approach is primarily ethnohistorical, although it draws on a number of interdisciplinary strategies. In particular, Bauer uses ""upstreaming,"" a critical strategy that moves toward the period under study by using present-day community members' connections to historical knowledge--for example, family histories and oral traditions--to interpret primary-source data. Additionally, Bauer employs archaeological data and material culture as a means of performing feminist recuperation, filling the gaps and silences left by the records, newspapers, and historical accounts as primarily written by and for white men. Ultimately, Becoming Catawba effects a welcome intervention at the intersections of Native, women's, and Southern history, expanding the diversity and modes of experience in the fraught, multifaceted cultural environment of the early American South.","Tuscaloosa : The University of Alabama Press, [2023]",English,,,"1 online resource ( xvi, 245 pages) : illustrations, maps.",File type: text file,,,LCCN (canceled or invalid): 2022017510,010725280,"The first book-length study of the role Catawba women played in creating and preserving a cohesive tribal identity over three centuries of colonization and cultural turmoil.

Beyond the Informal - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,Suhartini,"This book provides a much-needed analysis of the pivotal role of the urban kampung in Indonesia's urbanization process and importantly, provides a deeper understanding of how these communities create their complex socio-physical environments through self-organization. The book challenges the current formal approaches and practices to modern planning in Indonesia where many kampungs are classed as illegal and excluded from city plans. Beyond informality unpacks via three case studies the self-generated planning and development arrangements and mechanisms which occur parallel to processes of formal exclusion, adaptation, negotiation and modification. Kampungs are posited as inseparable urban entities contributing to the complex assemblage of the city and the dynamics of contemporary urban planning and design.  In the context of planning and design practice, this book provides a better understanding on how one needs to consider human-scale urbanism to achieve more effective and efficient planning plans and policies in the self-organized city. Even though self-organization by residents comes with its challenges as outlined in the book, formal planning in both Indonesia and other developing countries has much to learn from understanding self-organized settlements (kampung) and informal settlements 'as they are'.","[Place of publication not identified] : Springer International Publishing, 2023.",,,Title from content provider.,1 online resource,,,,,010853444,"Beyond the Informal unpacks the self-generated planning and development arrangements and mechanisms which occur parallel to processes of formal exclusion, adaptation, negotiation and modification.

"BIG CON : HOW THE CONSULTING INDUSTRY WEAKENS OUR BUSINESSES, INFANTILIZES OUR GOVERNMENTS, AND WARPS. - Duke University Libraries Catalog",,"MAZZUCATO, MARIANA","A vital and timely investigation into the opaque and powerful consulting industry--and what to do about it   There is an entrenched relationship between the consulting industry and the way business and government are managed today that must change. Mariana Mazzucato and Rosie Collington show that our economies' reliance on companies such as McKinsey & Company, Boston Consulting Group, Bain & Company, PwC, Deloitte, KPMG, and EY stunts innovation, obfuscates corporate and political accountability, and impedes our collective mission of halting climate breakdown.  The ""Big Con"" describes the confidence trick the consulting industry performs in contracts with hollowed-out and risk-averse governments and shareholder value-maximizing firms. It grew from the 1980s and 1990s in the wake of reforms by the neoliberal right and Third Way progressives, and it thrives on the ills of modern capitalism, from financialization and privatization to the climate crisis. It is possible because of the unique power that big consultancies wield through extensive contracts and networks--as advisors, legitimators, and outsourcers--and the illusion that they are objective sources of expertise and capacity. In the end, the Big Con weakens our businesses, infantilizes our governments, and warps our economies.  In The Big Con, Mazzucato and Collington throw back the curtain on the consulting industry. They dive deep into important case studies of consultants taking the reins with disastrous results, such as the debacle of the roll out of HealthCare.gov and the tragic failures of governments to respond adequately to the COVID-19 pandemic. The result is an important and exhilarating intellectual journey into the modern economy's beating heart.

Big data analytics in smart manufacturing : principles and practices - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Suresh, P., 1983-","The significant objective of this edited book is to bridge the gap between smart manufacturing and big data by exploring the challenges and limitations. Companies employ big data technology in the manufacturing field to acquire data about the products. Manufacturing companies could gain a deep business insight by tracking customer details, monitoring fuel consumption, detecting product defects, and supply chain management. Moreover, the convergence of smart manufacturing and big data analytics currently suffers due to data privacy concern, short of qualified personnel, inadequate investment, long-term storage management of high-quality data. The technological advancement makes the data storage more accessible, cheaper and the convergence of these technologies seems to be more promising in the recent era. This book identified the innovative challenges in the industrial domains by integrating heterogeneous data sources such as structured data, semi-structures data, geo-spatial data, textual information, multimedia data, social networking data, etc. It promotes data-driven business modelling processes by adopting big data technologies in the manufacturing industry. Big data analytics is emerging as a promising discipline in the manufacturing industry to build the rigid industrial data platforms. Moreover, big data facilitates process automation in the complete lifecycle of product design and tracking.

Bio-Inspired Land Remediation - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Pandey, Vimal Chandra","Land is fundamental to the human life. The upper layer of land is a non-renewable resource, and source of food. Therefore, land health is essential to long-term food security and to promote sustainable livelihoods. On account of urbanization, industrialization and population growth, land pollution is one of the major issues worldwide. As a result, land pollution is continuing across the world, and has been linked with a wide range of potentially toxic contaminants at rates that deteriorate land quality. Land pollution can result either anthropogenic activities or natural activities. The major contaminants of land pollution are metalloids, petroleum hydrocarbon, radioactive elements, polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), Pesticide, other organic pollutants, etc. that comes from different types of sources. In urban and peri-urban areas, irrigation of agricultural land with polluted water is also a reason of land pollution. Therefore, land security is an important issue for future sustainability. Its remediation and management are important issue worldwide to protect land quality and functions. Land pollution means degradation of earth's surface. Polluted land comes under the category of degraded land. Hence, the remediation of polluted land is essential for regaining biodiversity and ecosystems services and thereby achieving United Nations-Sustainable Development Goals (UN-SDGs).This fact showed the need to develop research into land remediation. Bio-inspired land remediation has undergone a huge development. Therefore, Biomanagement has a lot of potential to secure upper earth's surface through the land remediation programs targeted during the United Nations Decade on Ecosystem Restoration (2021-2030). This book explores the remediation of land pollution that includes Phytoremediation, Bioremediation (bacterial remediation and fungal remediation), Vermiremediation, Biochar-based remediation and other Bio-inspired remediation. This book will be a remarkable asset for research scholars, environmentalists, ecological scientist, agriculturist, practitioners, policy makers, entrepreneurs, and other stakeholders alike.","[Place of publication not identified] : Springer, 2023.",,,Title from content provider.,1 online resource,,,,,010853456,"The upper layer of land is a non-renewable resource, and source of food.

"Biodiversity, Functional Ecosystems and Sustainable Food Production - Duke University Libraries Catalog",,"Galanakis, Charis M.","In recent decades, practices like the cultivation of a few high-yielding crop varieties on a large scale, the application of heavy machinery and continued mechanization of agriculture, the removal of natural habitats, and the application of pesticides and synthetics have resulted in the simplification of agro-ecosystems. This has enabled a substantial increase in food production but has at the same time transformed landscapes. Indeed, there is a concern that a decline in biodiversity has affected microbiome activities that support processes across soils, plants, animals, the marine environment, and humans. Although they have increased food production, the above practices cannot be considered sustainable in long-term applications. Biodiversity, Functional Ecosystems, and Sustainable Food Production explore ecosystems in terms of crop and animal production, pest and disease control, nutrient cycling, and soil fertility. Chapters range from agro-biodiversity to antimicrobial use in animal food production to microbiome applications for sustainable food systems and the impacts of environment-friendly unit operations on the functional properties of bee pollen.

BLACK RODEO : A HISTORY OF THE AFRICAN AMERICAN WESTERN. - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"MASK, MIA, 1969-","African American westerns have a rich cinematic history and visual culture. Mia Mask examines the African American western hero within the larger context of film history by considering how Black westerns evolved and approached wide-ranging goals. Woody Strode's 1950s transformation from football star to actor was the harbinger of hard-edged western heroes later played by Jim Brown and Fred Williamson. Sidney Poitier's Buck and the Preacher provided a narrative helmed by a groundbreaking African American director and offered unconventionally rich roles for women. Mask moves from these discussions to consider blaxploitation westerns and an analysis of Jeff Kanew's hard-to-find 1972 documentary about an all-Black rodeo. The book addresses how these movies set the stage for modern-day westploitation films like Django Unchained .  A first-of-its kind survey, Black Rodeo illuminates the figure of the Black cowboy while examining the intersection of African American film history and the western.

Blockchain in Healthcare - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,Stawicki,"​Blockchain technology (BT) is quietly transforming the world, from financial infrastructure, to the internet-of-things, to healthcare applications. With increasing penetration of BT into various areas of our daily lives, the need arises for better awareness and greater knowledge about the capabilities, benefits, risks, and alternatives to distributed ledger applications. It is hoped that current book will be one of the pioneering collections focusing on blockchain implementations in the area of healthcare, with specific aim to present content in an easy-to-understand and readily accessible way for typical end-users of blockchain-based applications. There are important areas within the fabric of modern healthcare that stand to benefit from implementations of BT. These areas include electronic medical records, quality control, patient safety, finance, device tracking, biostamping/biocertification, redundant storage of critical data, health and liability insurance, medication utilization tracking (including opioid and antibiotic misuse), financial transactions, academics/education, asset tokenization, public health and pandemics, healthcare provider credentialing, and many other potential applications. The ultimate goal of the proposed book would be to provide an integrative, easy-to-understand, and comprehensive picture of the current state of blockchain use in healthcare while actively engaging the reader in a forward-looking, exploratory approach toward future developments in this space. To accomplish this goal, an expert panel of contributors has been assembled, featuring scholars from top global universities and think-tanks.","[Place of publication not identified] : Springer International Publishing, 2023.",,,Title from content provider.,1 online resource,,,,,010853479,"Duke University Libraries Catalog: Blockchain technology (BT) is quietly transforming the world, from financial infrastructure, to the internet-of-things, to healthcare applications.

Boards of directors in disruptive times : improving corporate governance effectiveness - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Canals, Jordi","The current business context of disruptive, accelerated change requires a new framework for understanding how boards of directors can best support their organizations. In this book, Professor Jordi Canals presents a new model of effective governance, positioning the board of directors as the steward of the firm's future development, and focusing on the notion of corporate purpose. Canals argues that boards of directors should focus on strategy and corporate transformation, CEO and senior management development and succession, the board and the firm's culture, the board as a team, the engagement of shareholders and critical stakeholders, and the firm's overall impact.

Body and force in music : metaphoric constructions in music psychology - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Kim, Youn","Our understanding of music is inherently metaphorical, and metaphoricity pervades all sorts of musical discourses, be they theoretical, analytical, philosophical, pedagogical, or even scientific. The notions of body and force are the two most pervasive and comprehensive scientific metaphors in musical discourse.

Youn Kim investigates these concepts of body and force in the emerging field of music psychology in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.

Given the risks and institutional barriers, why and how do people mobilize for justice in states with rampant impunity and weak rule of law?In Bootstrap Justice, Janice Gallagher leverages over a decade of ethnographic research to explain what enables the sustained mobilization of family members of the disappeared and analyze how configurations of political power between state and criminal actors shape what is possible for them toachieve. She follows three families from before the disappearance of their loved ones through their transformations into sophisticated and strategic victim advocates and activists. Gallagher supplements these individual narratives with an analysis of the evolving political opportunities formobilization within Mexico.By centering the perspectives of people whose lives have been upended by the disappearance of their loved ones, Bootstrap Justice offers a unique window into how citizens respond to weak and corrupt institutions.

Botanical poetics : early modern plant books and the husbandry of print - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Rosenberg, Jessica, 1982-","During the middle years of Queen Elizabeth's reign, the number of books published with titles that described themselves as flowers, gardens, or forests more than tripled. During those same years, English printers turned out scores of instructional manuals on gardening and husbandry, retailing useful knowledge to a growing class of literate landowners and pleasure gardeners. Both trends, Jessica Rosenberg shows, reflected a distinctive style of early modern plant-thinking, one that understood both plants and poems as composites of small pieces--slips or seeds to be recirculated by readers and planters. Botanical Poetics brings together studies of ecology, science, literary form, and the material text to explore how these developments transformed early modern conceptions of nature, poetic language, and the printed book. Drawing on little-studied titles in horticulture and popular print alongside poetry by Shakespeare, Spenser, and others, Rosenberg reveals how early modern print used a botanical idiom to anticipate histories of its own reading and reception, whether through replanting, uprooting, or fantasies of common property and proliferation.

Hill and Otto Meyerhof - Duke University Libraries Catalog",,"Brown, Andrew","In Bound by Muscle, Andrew Brown details the lives and achievements of two physiologists, Archibald Vivian Hill (1886-1977) and Otto Fritz Meyerhof (1884-1951). Hill and Meyerhof shared the 1922 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for discoveries related to metabolic changes underlyingmuscle activity. Bound by Muscle describes how Hill and Meyerhof's lives and careers intersected and diverged and how their work changed the course of biological science.Bound by Muscle is organized chronologically. The first four chapters consider Hill and Meyerhof's childhoods and early careers; subsequent chapters address the Nobel Prize nomination and award and how their lives were affected by the World Wars. Bound by Muscle details Hill and Meyerhof'sscientific breakthroughs and professional accomplishments. The book also examines the historical context that shaped their work and how the two men differed. Hill embodied the pragmatic style of British science. He became an outspoken critic of fascism as well as an effective humanitarian. As asenior scientist, he played major roles in preparing Great Britain for World War II.

"Boycott theory and the struggle for Palestine : universities, intellectualism and liberation - Duke University Libraries Catalog",,"Riemer, Nick, 1972-","The academic boycott of Israel, a branch of the pro-Palestinian Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) campaign, is one of the richest-and most divisive-topics in the politics of knowledge today. In Boycott Theory and the Struggle for Palestine, Nick Riemer addresses the most fundamental questions raised by the call to sever ties with Israeli universities, and offers fresh arguments for doing so. More than a narrow study of the boycott campaign, the book details how academic BDS relates to a range of live controversies in progressive politics on questions such as disruptive protest, silencing and free speech, the real-world consequences of intellectual work, the rise of the far right, and the nature of grassroots campaigning. Written for open-minded readers, the book presents the fullest justification for the academic boycott yet given, considering BDS efforts on campuses around the world. The opening chapters explore the fundamentals of the academic boycott campaign, detailing the conditions on the ground in Palestinian and Israeli higher education and analyzing debates over the boycott and its adoption or resistance in the west. The later chapters contextualize the boycott with respect to broader questions about the links between theory and practice in political change. Directly rebutting the arguments of BDS's opponents, Boycott Theory and the Struggle for Palestine demonstrates the political and intellectual soundness of a controversial and often misrepresented campaign. In defending an original view of the differences between reflecting on politics and doing it in the specific context of the liberation of Palestine, the book's arguments will have a resonance for many wider debates beyond the context of either universities or the Middle East.","Lanham : Rowman & Littlefield, [2023]",English,,Includes bibliographical references and index.,"ix, 213 pages ; 24 cm.",,,1351934286.0,LCCN: ^^2022038023,010791385,"Academic boycott of Israel is a branch of the pro-Palestinian Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) campaign.

Breaking intersubjectivity : a critical theory of counter-revolutionary trauma in Egypt - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Matthies-Boon, Vivienne","Trauma is commonly understood as Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Yet, as this book explains, the concept of PTSD is problematic because it is rooted in a solipsist Philosophy of the Subject. Within such a philosophical perspective, it is not only impossible to account for trauma's causality, but the traumatic 'event' is also prioritised over traumatic social and political structures as trauma is depoliticised as an (individual) internal cognitive object. Rooted in Frankfurt School critical theory, this book thus urges us to rethink the concept of trauma: trauma should not be understood as impaired subjectivity but rather as broken intersubjectivity. Hence, it not only presents a critique of the notion 'PTSD', but - drawing on the philosophies of Jurgen Habermas, Nancy Fraser, Rahel Jaeggi and Heideggerian trauma theory in particular - it argues that trauma entails the violent imposition of traumatic status subordination. In traumatic status subordination, intersubjective parity (the counterfactual presupposition of being treated as an equal human being) is so violently betrayed that the symbolic realm of the lifeworld collapses. As the lifeworld collapses, one suffers an atomized state of speechless disorientation, wherein the potential of creative collective becoming is destroyed. In this sense, human induced trauma should thus be understood as a political tool par excellence. As this monograph indicates, traumatic status subordination was a tool which the Egyptian counter-revolutionary actors (consisting of the Egyptian military, and its temporary subsidiary the Muslim Brotherhood) used unsparingly as they attempted to put the revolutionary genie back into the bottle. Importantly, the Egyptian military not only sought to destroy the object of revolutionary politics, but rather the underlying existential structures of the possibility of its very existence as such. And thus, in the violent instrumental pursuit of economic and political power, the counter-revolution inflicted multileveled status subordination. It did so through a consistent tripartite structural mechanism: the infliction of grave (deadly) violence, the procedural colonisation and repressive juridification of the public sphere, and the acceleration of neoliberal economic rationalism. This not only accumulated in Sisi's prisonification of society and his politics of death, but rather also threw activists ever deeper into an atomized state of demoralized silence as it destroyed the very potential of revolutionary and transformative becoming.","Lanham : Rowman & Littlefield, [2023]",English,,Includes bibliographical references (pages 305-327) and index.,"xiii, 337 pages ; 24 cm.",,History,1336012137.0,LCCN: 2022023378British national bibliography: GBC2E0831,010850711,"The concept of PTSD is problematic because it is rooted in a solipsist Philosophy of the Subject.

Brilliant Commodity : Diamonds and Jews in a Modern Setting - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"snyder, coenen","Following diamonds from African mines to the necklines of high society women, this international history shows why Jews were central to the transatlantic gem trade and its growth into a global industry.During the late nineteenth century, tens of thousands of diggers, prospectors, merchants, and dealers extracted and shipped over 50 million carats of diamonds from South Africa to London. The primary supplier to the world, South Africa's diamond fields became one of the formative sites of moderncapitalist production. At each stage of the diamond's route through the British empire and beyond-from Cape Town to London, from Amsterdam to New York City-carbon gems were primarily mined, processed, appraised, and sold by Jews.In A Brilliant Commodity, historian Saskia Coenen Snyder traces how once-peripheral Jewish populations became the central architects of a new, global exchange of diamonds that connected African sites of supply, European manufacturing centers, American retailers, and western consumers. Centuries ofrestrictions had limited Jews to trade and finance, businesses that often heavily relied on internal networks. Jews were well-positioned to become key players in the earliest stage of the diamond trade and its growth into a global industry, a development fueled by technological advancements, adramatic rise in the demand of luxury goods, and an abundance of rough stones. Relying on mercantile and familial ties across continents, Jews created a highly successful commodity chain that included buyers, brokers, cutters, factory owners, financiers, and retailers.Working within a diasporic ethnic community that bridged city and countryside, metropole and colony, Jews helped build a flourishing diamond industry, notably Hatton Garden in London and the Diamond District of New York City, and a place for themselves in the modern world.","[Place of publication not identified] : Oxford University Press USA, 2023.",,,Title from content provider.,1 online resource,,,,,010758749,"A Brilliant Commodity: Diamonds and Jews in a Modern Setting - Duke University Libraries catalog.

Bringing Skepticism to Crop Science - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,Sinclair,"Global food production and climate change among other concerns are societal issues that require major research input from crop science. While suggestions are abundant on how crop science can help to resolve these issues, many of the suggestions come from people who are not actually familiar with the challenges and requirements to modify crop plants grown under field conditions to achieve the necessary improvements. Efforts to alter a gene or even several genes have very rarely proven successful in having impact on crop production under realistic field conditions. This lack of success has not been addressed head on. This book serves as a reminder to crop scientists and others that open, clear-minded assessments of the entirety of evidence concerning a hypothesis is required before making claims of possible increases in crop performance. This attitude of skepticism is not a negative attitude but rather an employment of the cornerstone of scientific investigation based on formation and evaluation of hypotheses. Skeptical analyses are to be presented in the book on some of the common suggestions for improving crop plants. The six specific topics to be addressed are photosynthesis, seed number, nitrogen use efficiency, water use efficiency, crop water loss, and unconfirmed field observations. Each of the topics in this book, will first be reviewed to present the origins of the popular assumptions about how specific plant modification will result in improved crop performance. The review of the background information will be followed by an examination of the evidence, logic, and predicted outcomes for the assumed benefits of the modifications. Finally, each chapter will offer novel, alternate approaches to plant modification that have documented support for positively impacting crop performance. The book will not be written in specialized, detail language but offer access for those with a wide range of interests in options for increasing crop production in the future. The goal of the book is to provide information that is useful to those with interests ranging from climatologist to food-oriented sociologists. Of course, the topics covered will be of direct interest to those studying plant sciences, particularly crop scientists. The hope is to challenge a reader to re-examine some of her/his assumptions about crop improvement and approach the topic with a renewed practice of skepticism in formulating and evaluating hypotheses.","[Place of publication not identified] : Springer, 2023.",,,Title from content provider.,1 online resource,,,,,010788393,"Bringing Skepticism to Crop Science is a book on some of the common suggestions for improving crop plants.

Broadway has long preserved the ideology of the ""Broadway Body"": the hyper-fit, exceptionally able, triple-threat performer who represents how Broadway musicals favor certain kinds of bodies. Casting is always a political act, situated within a power structure that gives preference to the Broadway Body.  In Broadway Bodies, author Ryan Donovan explores how ability, sexuality, and size intersect with gender, race, and ethnicity in casting and performance. To understand these intersectional relationships, he poses a series of questions: Why did A Chorus Line, a show that sought to individuate dancers, inevitably make dancers indistinguishable? How does the use of fat suits in musicals like Dreamgirls and Hairspray stigmatize fatness? What were the political implications of casting two straight actors as the gay couple in La Cage aux Folles in 1983? How did deaf actors change the sound of musicals in Deaf West's Broadway revivals? Whose bodies does Broadway cast and whose does it cast aside?  In answering these questions, Broadway Bodies tells a history of Broadway's inclusion of various forms of embodied difference while revealing its simultaneous ambivalence toward non-conforming bodies.","New York : Oxford University Press, [2023]©2023",English,,Includes bibliographical references (pages 275-302) and index.,"xii, 316 pages : illustrations (black and white) ; 24 cm",,"Criticism, interpretation, etcHistory",1347269266.0,LCCN: ^^2022040722,010859005,"Ryan Donovan explores how ability, sexuality, and size intersect with gender, race, and ethnicity in casting and performance.

Budget superpower : how Russia challenges the West with an economy smaller than Texas' - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Ruehl, John","The Kremlin's ability to shape global affairs appeared decimated following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. Coupled with the internal instability that gripped Russia in the 1990s, Moscow struggled to develop a coherent and effective foreign policy for almost a decade. But under President Vladimir Putin, Russia has steadily reemerged as one of the most significant countries in the world--and one that is increasingly willing to challenge the United States. In Budget Superpower, geopolitics journalist John P. Ruehl explores how Russia has achieved this feat, despite its relatively limited economic strength. The book is divided into eight chapters, each exploring a tool or approach of the Kremlin's and how and where it has used this method to maximize Russia's influence. Each chapter also analyzes the weaknesses and vulnerabilities of Russia's strategies, as well as cautious predictions for how they may evolve in the future. Russia's determination to confront the United States has become increasingly apparent over the last decade, culminating in the 2022 invasion of Ukraine.

"Business, religion and the law : church and business autonomy in the secular economy - Duke University Libraries Catalog",,"Corsalini, Matteo","This book investigates the intersection between business and religion from a legal perspective. Taking a fresh look at some of the most compelling literature in law and religion, it proposes a rethinking of what scholars on both sides of the Atlantic have dubbed ""church autonomy"" or, more recently, ""corporate religious freedom"".The volume explores how, in the wake of a decade of US Supreme Court case law, corporate religious freedom is now increasingly being extended to protect the religious liberty of another corporate entity: the for-profit corporation. By exposing this shift from church to business autonomy in American law, it is argued that a similar narrative has also begun to take place in Europe. Through a comparative and interdisciplinary approach to corporate religious freedom, the work provides the reader with a new, comprehensive, and easily accessible history of the genesis and evolution of this legal category in American and European law.The book combines material that straddles international law and religion, corporate law, and economic theory. The diversity of views contained within it makes it a valuable resource for scholars and students in law and religion, corporate social responsibility, and law and economics.

Caesar rules : the Emperor in the changing Roman world (c. 50 BC - AD 565) - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Hekster, Olivier","For centuries, Roman emperors ruled a vast empire. Yet, at least officially, the emperor did not exist. No one knew exactly what titles he possessed, how he could be portrayed, what exactly he had to do, or how the succession was organised.

There were also expectations about what he should do and be, although these varied throughout the empire and also evolved over time. How did these expectations develop and change? To what degree could an emperor deviate from prevailing norms?

Cajun literature and Cajun collective memory - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Köstler, Mathilde","How does Cajun literature, emerging in the 1980s, represent the dynamic processes of remembering in Cajun culture?  Known for its hybrid constitution and deeply ingrained oral traditions, Cajun culture provides an ideal testing ground for investigating the collective memory of a group. In particular, francophone and anglophone Cajun texts by such writers as Jean Arceneaux, Tim Gautreaux, Jeanne Castille, Zachary Richard, Ron Thibodeaux, Darrell Bourque, and Kirby Jambon reveal not only a shift from an oral to a written tradition. They also show hybrid perspectives on the Cajun collective memory. Based on recurring references to place, the texts also reflect on the (Acadian) past and reveal the innate ability of the Cajuns to adapt through repeated intertextual references.

California's recall election of Gavin Newsom : Covid-19 and the test of leadership - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Gerston, Larry N.","California went through a political earthquake of sorts when the state recalled Governor Gray Davis in 2003. In 2021, the state faced another political turning point with the threatened recall of Governor Gavin Newsom. Less than two years after Newsom's overwhelming election victory, more than two million Californians signed on to the recall effort, hoping to expel him from office in a special election. How could such a monumental turnabout be possible?　 Normally, the political headwinds would be much too strong for a movement to oust a governor who had decisively vanquished his opponent. But--with the COVID-19 pandemic dominating every aspect of society, including politics--these weren't normal times. Organizing a recall election is a demanding enterprise: it takes abundant political energy, tremendous amounts of anger with the status quo, and mounds of money. Yet, for the second time in less than two decades, such wheels were set in motion. What is it that makes California so dynamic yet so fragile? This book explains that paradox and, in the process, enlightens readers about the recall process, the challenges of federalism, and the pitfalls of direct democracy. It examines the underlying conditions that expose a state with poorly linked institutions, a bitterly divided society, and a governor who had to act under nearly impossible conditions, demonstrating his strengths and vulnerabilities along the way. It's a story that could happen only in California, a state with a history of ""only"" stories.","New York ; London : Routledge, Taylor & Francis Group, 2023.",English,,Includes bibliographical references.,1 online resource.,File type: text file,Electronic books,,LCCN: 2022003617,010600968,"California went through a political earthquake of sorts when the state recalled Governor Gray Davis in 2003.

Many students from the ""Protest Triangle"" (the author's term for activists at the three HBCUs) and the ""Research Triangle"" viewed efforts by politicians to thwart protest participation as restrictions of their academic freedom.

Capital and Ressentiment : A Short Theory of the Present. - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Vogl, Joseph","The proliferation of social media has provided ideal conditions in which feelings of anger and frustration can be expressed and shared, forming a deep pool of ressentiment that is being drawn upon and exploited by populist and authoritarian leaders.  In his new book, Joseph Vogl shows how this dynamic is rooted in the fusing of finance capital and information in a new form of information capitalism that is reshaping the affective economy of our societies. The capital accumulation strategies of powerful new platforms and social media are pushing people into fragmented, opposing, and conflictual communities where ressentiment is nurtured and grows. The feelings of grievance and rejection generated by capitalism are redirected into attacks on migrants, foreigners, and others, thereby deflecting their critical potential, and bolstering the system that is their source. It is the cunning of ressentiment that provides the key to understanding why, despite the profusion of communication in our social media age, global finance and information capital can be neither understood nor attacked as a totalizing power.  This brilliant analysis of the ways in which information capitalism is transforming the affective economy of our societies will be of great interest to anyone concerned with the forces that are shaping our societies today.","Newark, NJ : Polity Press, 2023.",English,,,1 online resource ( 222 p.) :,Color characteristics: polychromeFile type: text file,,,,010744130,"The proliferation of social media has provided ideal conditions in which feelings of anger and frustration can be expressed and shared, forming a deep pool of ressentiment that is being drawn upon and exploited by populist and authoritarian leaders.

Capture Japan : visual culture and the global imagination from 1952 to the present - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Bohr, Marco, 1978-","Capture Japan investigates the formation of visual tropes and how these have contributed to perceptions of Japan in the global imagination. The book proposes that images are not incidental in the formation of such perceptions, but central to notions about identity, history and memory. From a tentative western ally in 1952 to a 'soft power' superpower with a huge global influence in the 21st century, the book locates questions about Japan in the global imagination to the country's transforming geopolitical position. By adopting an interdisciplinary approach, with a multiplicity of perspectives from around the world, Capture Japan goes beyond binarisms to uncover how images can also produce discourses that challenge, subvert or even contradict each other.  The word 'capture' in the title of the book recognises both the deeply problematic role that images have played in relation to colonialism, as well as the potential dominance that visual spectacles can wield in a contemporary context. Diverse essays from a wide range of perspectives investigate the institutional framework that has allowed certain types of images of Japan to be promoted, while others have been suppressed.

CARNIVAL IN ALABAMA : MARKED BODIES AND INVENTED TRADITIONS IN MOBILE. - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Machado, Isabel","Mobile is simultaneously a typical and unique city in the postwar United States. It was a quintessential boomtown during World War II. That prosperity was followed by a period of rapid urban decline and subsequent attempts at revitalizing (or gentrifying) its downtown area. As in many other US cities, urban renewal, integration, and other socioeconomic developments led to white flight, marginalized the African American population, and set the stage for the development of LGBTQ+ community building and subculture. Yet these usually segregated segments of society in Mobile converged once a year to create a common identity, that of a Carnival City.  Carnival in Alabama looks not only at the people who participated in Mardi Gras organizations divided by race, gender, and/or sexual orientation, but also investigates the experience of ""marked bodies"" outside of these organizations, or people involved in Carnival through their labor or as audiences (or publics) of the spectacle. It also expands the definition of Mobile's Carnival ""tradition"" beyond the official pageantry by including street maskers and laborers and neighborhood cookouts.  Using archival sources and oral history interviews to investigate and analyze the roles assigned, inaccessible to, or claimed and appropriated by straight-identified African American men and women and people who defied gender and sexuality normativity in the festivities (regardless of their racial identity), this book seeks to understand power dynamics through culture and ritual.

Caste matters in public policy : issues and perspectives - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Choragudi, Rahul","Caste in India, despite its historical resilience, has been undergoing transformation since independence. If caste as a system of rigid stratification has been on the decline, castes as autonomous interest-serving groups have been on ascendance. This book critically engages with the changing notions of caste and its intersection with public policy in India. It discusses key issues such as social security, internal reservation, the idea of Most Backward Classes, caste issues among non-Hindu religious communities, caste in census, caste in market, and service castes and urban planning. Drawing on in-depth case studies from states including Andhra Pradesh, Delhi, Karnataka, Punjab, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, and West Bengal, the volume explores the cyclical process of how caste drives policies, and how policies in turn shape the reality of caste in India. It looks at the impact of factors like protective discrimination, adult franchise and democratic decentralisation, horizontal and vertical mobilisation, land reforms, and religious conversion on social mobility, and traditional hierarchy in India.","Abingdon, Oxon ; New York, NY : Routledge, Taylor & Francis Group, 2023.©2023",English,,Includes bibliographical references and index.,"1 online resource (xii, 233 pages) : illustrations.",File type: text file,Electronic books,,,010649438,"Caste in India, despite its historical resilience, has been undergoing transformation since independence.

Characterisation of the Mechanical Properties of Heat-Induced Protein Deposits in Immersed Cleaning Systems - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Liu, Jintian","During heat treatment in dairy production, the rapid formation of heat-induced fouling deposits on the plant surface leads to reduced efficiency of heat transfer. Therefore, a regular cleaning process is required to soften the heat-induced protein deposits and then remove them from the plant surface. The mechanical property of the deposits is one of the key issues of the cleaning mechanisms since the non-fractured behaviour dominates the deformation of the fouling layer and the failure behaviour has a great impact on the cohesive removal of fouling deposits. Considering the complicated geometry of fouling deposits and their irregular distribution, indentation experiments were carried out on various kinds of protein deposits. The experimental results reveal the significant influence of the thickness of fouling deposits on their mechanical behaviour and the time-dependent nonlinear behaviour of the deposits.","[Place of publication not identified] : Springer Nature, 2023.",,,Title from content provider.,1 online resource,,,,,010853850,Heat-induced protein deposits in dairy production lead to reduced efficiency of heat transfer.

CHARACTERISING IRONY : A SYSTEMATIC APPROACH TO LITERARY AND LINGUISTIC TEXTS. - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Pattison, Steven","This book offers a systematic, bottom-up account of irony across both everyday contexts and literary and linguistic texts, using an empirically rigorous approach in distinguishing between central irony, non-central ironies, and non-ironies and highlighting a new way forward for irony research.The volume considers the current landscape of irony, in which the term is used with increasing frequency with the knock-on effect of a loosening of its meaning. Pattison addresses this challenge by applying a systematic form of analysis, rooted in frameworks from pragmatics and complementary disciplines, to a database of over 500 irony candidates from a wide range of sources. The book uses these examples to illustrate the features of central ironies as well as the attributes used to differentiate between central ironies, non-central ironies, and non-ironies. These attributes are mapped across four key domains, including: difference and opposition; the role of context; how ironies are signaled; and speaker attitude and intention. Taken together, the volume puts forth a credible account for more clearly characterizing examples of irony and equips researchers with a comprehensive step-by-step method for undertaking future research.This book is key reading for scholars in stylistics, pragmatics, literary studies, and psycholinguistics.

In this collection of critical essays, scholars discuss works that cover wide-ranging subjects and themes: growing up deaf in a hearing world, stigmas associated with deafness, rival modes of communication, friendship and discrimination, intergenerational tensions between hearing and nonhearing family members, and the complications of establishing self-identity in increasingly complex societies. Contributors explore most of the major genres of children's literature and film, including realistic fiction, particularly young adult novels, as well as works that make deft use of humor and parody. Further, scholars consider the expressive power of multimodal forms such as graphic novel and film to depict experience from the perspective of children.  Representation of the point of view of child characters is central to this body of work and to the intersections of deafness with discourses of diversity and social justice. The child point of view supports a subtle advocacy of a wider understanding of the multiple ways of being D/deaf and the capacity of D/deaf children to give meaning to their unique experiences, especially as they find themselves moving between hearing and Deaf communities.

The child point of view supports a subtle advocacy of a wider understanding of the multiple ways of being D/deaf.","In this collection of critical essays, scholars discuss works that cover wide-ranging subjects and themes: growing up deaf in a hearing world, stigmas associated with deafness, rival modes of communication, friendship and discrimination, intergenerational tensions between hearing and nonhearing family members, and the complications of establishing self-identity in increasingly complex societies. These essays will alert scholars of children's literature, as well as the reading public, to the many representations of deafness that, like deafness itself, pervade all cultures and are not limited to specific racial or sociocultural groups. The child point of view supports a subtle advocacy of a wider understanding of the multiple ways of being D/deaf and the capacity of D/deaf children to give meaning to their unique experiences, especially as they find themselves moving between hearing and Deaf communities. Further, scholars consider the expressive power of multimodal forms such as graphic novel and film to depict experience from the perspective of children. Representation of the point of view of child characters is central to this body of work and to the intersections of deafness with discourses of diversity and social justice."

The chimpanzees of Rubondo Island : apes set free - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Msindai, Josephine Nadezda","How did a random batch of chimpanzees come to populate a small island in Tanzania where apes had never lived before? Combining information gathered from fieldwork, laboratory and archival research, this book tells the unique story of chimpanzee babies taken from their forest homes in West-Central Africa and sold to European zoos and circuses, to then be shipped to Lake Victoria and set free on Rubondo Island. These founder animals learnt what to eat, how to build nests, to breed and raise young - ultimately forming a chimpanzee-typical fission-fusion society that today is thriving. The authors compare the ecology, behaviour and genetics of the Rubondo population with communities of wild chimpanzees, providing exciting insights into how our closest relatives adjust to changing environments. At the same time, a reconstruction of the historical context of the Rubondo experiment reflects on its chequered colonial heritage, and the introduction is viewed against current threats to the survival of apes in their natural habitats.

Churchill's American Arsenal : The Partnership Behind the Innovations That Won World War Two - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,Ferreiro,"Churchill's American Arsenal reveals how the technology, know-how, and production power behind the victorious Allied partnership during World War II extended beyond the battlefront and onto the home-front.  Many weapons and inventions were credited with winning World War II, most famously in the assertion that the atomic bomb ""ended the war, but radar won the war."" What is less well known is that both airborne radar and the atomic bomb were invented in British laboratories, but built by Americans. The same holds true for many other American weapons credited with the Allied victory: the P-51 Mustang fighter, the Liberty ship, the proximity fuze, the Sherman tank, and even penicillin all began with British scientists and planners, but were designed and mass-produced by American engineers and factory workers. Churchill's American Arsenal chronicles this vital but often fraught relationship between British inventiveness and American technical might.  At first, leaders in each nation were deeply skeptical that such a relationship could ever be successful. But despite initial misunderstandings, petty jealousies, and continuing differences over priorities, scientists and engineers on both sides of the Atlantic found new and often ingenious ways to work together, jointly creating the weapons that often became the decisive factor in the strategy for victory that Churchill had laid out during the earliest days of the conflict. While no single invention won the war, without any one of them, the war could have been lost.","[Place of publication not identified] : Oxford University Press USA, 2023.",,,Title from content provider.,1 online resource,,,,,010722165,"Both airborne radar and the atomic bomb were invented in British laboratories, but built by Americans.

"CINEMA IN THE ARAB WORLD : NEW HISTORIES, NEW APPROACHES - Duke University Libraries Catalog",,,"Cinema in the Arab world has been the subject of varied and rigorous studies, but most have focused on films as text, providing in-depth analyses of plot, style, ideologies, or examination of the biographies of prominent directors or actors.  This innovative new volume shifts the focus on Arab cinema off-screen, to examine the histories, politics, and conditions of distribution, exhibition, and cinema-going in the Arab world. Through broadening the frame of study beyond the screen, the book widens understanding of the cinema, not merely as a collection of films-as-texts, but as a site of cultural and political contestation in the Arab world.  Divided into two sections, and guided by interdisciplinary considerations, the contributors examine historical and contemporary issues of Arab cinema in terms of the experience of movie-going and filmmaking. They examine the networks of distribution and exhibition, as well as the contested and multiple meanings that the cinema embodied through diverse historical periods and geographical locations. Part I focuses on new histories of Arab cinema in terms of film production, distribution, exhibition and audience's experiences of cinema-going. Part II deals with more recent issues within scholarship on Arab cinema such as issues of politics, economics, ideologies, as well as issues related to Arab movies' international circulation and screenings at festivals.

"City of dignity : Christianity, liberalism, and the making of global Los Angeles - Duke University Libraries Catalog",,"Dempsey, Sean T.","City of Dignity illuminates how liberal Protestants quietly, yet indelibly, shaped the progressive ethics of postwar Los Angeles.   Contemporary Los Angeles is commonly seen as an American bulwark of progressive secular politics, a place that values immigration, equity, diversity, and human rights. But what accounts for the city's embrace of such staunchly liberal values, which are more hotly contested in other parts of the country? The answer, Sean Dempsey reveals, lies not with those frequent targets of credit and blame--Democrats in Hollywood--but instead with liberal Protestants and other steadfast religious organizations of the postwar era.  As the Religious Right movement emerged in the 1970s, progressive religious activists quietly began promoting an ethical vision that made waves worldwide but saw the largest impact in its place of origin: metropolitan Los Angeles. At the center of this vision lay the concept of human dignity--entwining the integral importance of political and expressive freedom with the moral sanctity of the human condition--which suffused all of the political values that arose from it, whether tolerance, diversity, or equality of opportunity. The work of these religious organizations birthed such phenomena as the Sanctuary Movement--which provided safe haven for refugees fleeing conflict-torn Central America--and advocacy for the homeless, both of which became increasingly fraught issues amid the rising tides of neoliberalism and conservatism. City of Dignity explores how these interwoven spiritual and theological strands found common ground--and made common impacts--in the humanitarian ecosystem of one of America's largest and most dynamic metro areas.","Chicago : The University of Chicago Press, 2023.",English,,Includes bibliographical references and index.,1 online resource (1 volume) : illustrations (black and white.,File type: text file,,,,010783311,"City of Dignity illuminates how liberal Protestants quietly, yet indelibly, shaped the progressive ethics of postwar Los Angeles.

Civil War field artillery : promise and performance on the battlefield - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Hess, Earl J.","The American Civil War saw the creation of the largest, most potent artillery force ever deployed in a conflict fought in the Western Hemisphere. It was as sizable and powerful as any raised in prior European wars. Moreover, Union and Confederate artillery included the largest number of rifled pieces fielded in any conflagration in the world up to that point. Earl J. Hess?s Civil War Field Artillery is the first comprehensive general history of the artillery arm that supported infantry and cavalry in the conflict. Based on deep and expansive research, it serves as an exhaustive examination with abundant new interpretations that reenvision the Civil War?s military.  Hess explores the major factors that affected artillerists and their work, including the hardware, the organization of artillery power, relationships between artillery officers and other commanders, and the influence of environmental factors on battlefield effectiveness. He also examines the lives of artillerymen, the use of artillery horses, manpower replacement practices, effects of the widespread construction of field fortifications on artillery performance, and the problems of resupplying batteries in the field. In one of his numerous reevalutions, Hess suggests that the early war practice of dispersing guns and assigning them to infantry brigades or divisions did not inhibit the massing of artillery power on the battlefield, and that the concentration system employed during the latter half of the conflict failed to produce a greater concentration of guns. In another break with previous scholarship, he shows that the efficacy of fuzes to explode long-range ordnance proved a problem that neither side was able to resolve during the war. Indeed, cumulative data on the types of projectiles fired in battle show that commanders lessened their use of the new long-range exploding ordnance due to bad fuzes and instead increased their use of solid shot, the oldest artillery projectile in history.","Baton Rouge : Louisiana State University Press, [2023]",English,,Includes bibliographical references and index.,"xxii, 396 pages : illustrations (black and white) ; 24 cm",,History,1322046905.0,LCCN: 2022014432British national bibliography: GBC2F7728,010792882,"Earl J.

Classical Covariant Fields - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,Burgess,"This 2002 book discusses the classical foundations of field theory, using the language of variational methods and covariance. It explores the limits of what can be achieved with purely classical notions, and shows how these have a deep and important connection with the second quantized field theory, which follows on from the Schwinger Action Principle. The book takes a pragmatic view of field theory, focusing on issues which are usually omitted from quantum field theory texts and cataloging results which are hard to find in the literature. Care is taken to explain how results arise and how to interpret them physically, for graduate students starting out in the field. An ideal supplementary text for courses on elementary field theory, group theory and dynamical systems, it is also a valuable reference for researchers working in these and related areas.

Climate change and ecosystems : challenges to sustainable development - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Fahad, Shah (Assistant professor of agriculture)","The global population is projected to increase by 3.3 billion from 6.7 billion in 2008 to 10 billion in 2100. As a result, soil degradation and desertification are growing due to the increasing demand for food, feed, fiber, and fuel on finite soil resources. The problem of global food insecurity may be further worsened by the threat of global warming. Climate change is showing its impacts in terms of increasing temperatures, variable rainfall, and an increase in climate-related extremes such as floods, droughts, cyclones, sea-level rise, salinity, and soil erosion. The agriculture sector is the most sensitive to climate change because the climate of a region/country determines the nature and characteristics of vegetation and crops. Increase in the mean seasonal temperature and decrease in effective precipitation can reduce the duration of many crops, may lead to outbreaks of pests and diseases, and hence reduce final yield ultimately affecting the food security of the country. Despite the positive impact of CO2 fertilization, the net productivity may decrease because of an increase in respiration rate, drought stress, and nutrient deficiency. For example, for every 75 ppm increase in CO2 concentration, rice yields will increase by 0.5 t/ha, but the yield will decrease by 0.6 t/ha for every 1°C increase in temperature. The global agricultural productivity is expected to decrease from 3% to 16% by 2080. The estimated decrease in agricultural productivity in the developing countries is 10%-25% in the 2080s, where average air temperature is already near or above crop tolerance levels.

Climate Change and Microbiome Dynamics - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,Parray,"The book provides an overview relevant to various biological mechanisms that regulate carbon exchanges between the major components and their response to climate change. Climate change has a significant impact on people's lives, energy demand, food security, etc. The soil microbial ecology is vital for assessing terrestrial and aquatic carbon cycles and climate feedback. However, the primary concern is the complexity of the soil microbial community and its severely affected functions due to the climate and other global changes. Global warming comprises an assessment of the dynamic interactions and feedback between microbes, plants, and their physical environment due to climate change. The book will address the need to use a multifactor experimental approach to understand how soil microorganisms and their activities adapt to climate change and the implications of carbon cycle feedback. The most pressing concern is a clearer understanding of the biological factors that regulate carbon exchanges between land, oceans, and the atmosphere and how these exchanges will respond to climate change via climate-ecosystem feedbacks, which could augment or quell regional and global climate change. Terrestrial ecosystems play an important role in climate feedback as they produce and absorb greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxides. They also strongly contribute to storing enormous amounts of carbon in living vegetation and soils, rendering them a significant global carbon sink. If climate change projections are realistic, such a rapid increase in carbon loss from soil could exacerbate the soil carbon cycle feedback. The book will determine the role of microbial feedback in regulating soil-land-atmosphere carbon exchange under changing climatic conditions at the regional and global levels. The current book will also focus on recent research designed to use beneficial microbes such as plant growth-promoting microorganisms, fungi, endophytic microbes, and others to improve understanding of the interaction and their potential role in promoting advanced management for sustainable agricultural solutions. Understanding the influence on the native microbiome, such as the distribution of methanogens and methanotrophs, nutritional content, microbial biomass, and other factors, is becoming increasingly crucial to establishing climate-resilient agriculture.","[Place of publication not identified] : Springer International Publishing, 2023.",,,Title from content provider.,1 online resource,,,,,010853891,"Climate change has a significant impact on people's lives, energy demand, food security, etc. The soil microbial ecology is vital for assessing terrestrial and aquatic carbon cycles and climate feedback.

Code name Blue Wren : the true story of America's most dangerous female spy--and the sister she betrayed - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Popkin, Jim","*Apple Book of the Month for January*    The incredible true story of Ana Montes, the most damaging female spy in US history, drawing upon never-before-seen material and to be published upon her release from prison, for readers of Agent Sonya and A Woman of No Importance.    Just days after the 9-11 attacks, a senior Pentagon analyst eased her red Toyota Echo into traffic and headed to work. She never saw the undercover cars tracking her every turn. As she settled into her cubicle on the 6th floor of the Defense Intelligence Agency in Washington, FBI Agents and twitchy DIA officers were hiding in nearby offices. For this was the day that Ana Montes--the US Intelligence Community superstar who had just won a prestigious fellowship at the CIA--was to be arrested and publicly exposed as a secret agent for Cuba.    Like spies Aldrich Ames and Robert Hanssen before her, Ana Montes blindsided her colleagues with brazen acts of treason. For nearly 17 years, Montes succeeded in two high-stress jobs. By day, she was one of the government's top Cuba experts, a buttoned-down GS-14 with shockingly easy access to classified documents. By night, she was on the clock for Fidel Castro, listening to coded messages over shortwave radio, passing US secrets to handlers in local restaurants, and slipping into Havana wearing a wig.     Montes didn't just deceive her country. Her betrayal was intensely personal. Her mercurial father was a former US Army Colonel. Her brother and sister-in-law were FBI Special Agents. And her only sister, Lucy, also worked her entire career for the Bureau. The highlight of her distinguished 31 years as a Miami-based language specialist: Helping the FBI flush Cuban spies out of the United States. Little did Lucy or her family know that the greatest Cuban spy of all was sitting right next to them at Thanksgivings, baptisms, and weddings.    In Code Name Blue Wren, investigative journalist Jim Popkin weaves the tale of two sisters who chose two very different paths, plus the unsung heroes who had to fight to bring Ana to justice. With exclusive access to a ""Secret"" CIA behavioral profile of Ana, family memoirs, and Ana's incriminating letters from prison, Popkin reveals the making of a traitor--a woman labelled ""one of the most damaging spies in U.S. history"" by America's top counter-intelligence official.

After more than two decades in federal prison, Montes will be freed in January 2023. She never saw the undercover cars tracking her every turn. As she settled into her cubicle on the 6th floor of the Defense Intelligence Agency in Washington, FBI Agents and twitchy DIA officers were hiding in nearby offices."
Coercive brain-reading in criminal justice : an analysis of European human rights law - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Ligthart, Sjors, 1993-","Emerging neurotechnology offers increasingly individualised brain information, enabling researchers to identify mental states and content. When accurate and valid, these brain-reading technologies also provide data that could be useful in criminal legal procedures, such as memory detection with EEG and the prediction of recidivism with fMRI. Yet, unlike in medicine, individuals involved in criminal cases will often be reluctant to undergo brain-reading procedures. This raises the question of whether coercive brain-reading could be permissible in criminal law. Coercive Brain-Reading in Criminal Justice examines this question in view of European human rights: the prohibition of ill-treatment, the right to privacy, freedom of thought, freedom of expression, and the privilege against self-incrimination. The book argues that, at present, the established framework of human rights does not exclude coercive brain-reading. It does, however, delimit the permissible use of forensic brain-reading without valid consent.

Coercive control and the criminal law - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Wiener, Cassandra","""This book considers how a phenomenon as complex as coercive control can be criminalised. The recognition and ensuing criminalisation of coercive control in the UK and Ireland has been the focus of considerable international attention. It has generated complex questions about the ""best"" way to criminalise domestic abuse. This work reviews recent domestic abuse criminal law reform in the UK and Ireland. In particular, it defines coercive control, and explains why using traditional criminal law approaches to prosecute it does not work. Laws passed in England and Wales versus Scotland represent two different approaches to translating coercive control into a criminal offence. This volume explains how and why the jurisdictions have taken different approaches and examines the advantages and disadvantages of each. As jurisdictions around the world review what steps need to be taken to improve national criminal justice responses to domestic abuse, the question of what works, and why, at the intersection of domestic abuse and the criminal law has never been more important. As such, the book will be a vital resource for lawyers, policy makers and activists with an interest in domestic abuse law reform"" --Provided by publisher.","Abingdon, Oxon ; New York, NY : Routledge, 2023.",English,,Description based on print version record.Includes bibliographical references and index.,1 online resource (pages cm),File type: text file,,,LCCN: 2022036801,010800436,"The recognition and ensuing criminalisation of coercive control in the UK and Ireland has been the focus of considerable international attention.

Manchuria Film Association had two tasks: to make ""national policy films"" as part of a cultural mission of educating Chinese in Manchukuo (the puppet state created in 1932) on the special relationship between Japan and the region, and to block the exhibition of Chinese films from Shanghai that contained anti-Japanese messages.

Yuxin Ma seeks to move the conversation beyond such simplistic and inaccurate depictions.  By focusing on the daily challenges and experiences of the Chinese workers at the corporation, Ma examines how life was actually lived by people navigating between practical and ideological concerns. She illustrates how the inhabitants of Manchukuo navigated social opportunities, economic depression, educational reforms, fascist rule, commercial interests, practical daily needs, and more-and reveals ways in which these conflicting preoccupations sometimes manifested as tension and ambiguity on screen. In the battle between repression and expression, these Chinese actors, directors, writers, and technicians adopted defensive and opportunistic tactics. They did so in colonial spaces, often rejecting modernist representations of Manchukuo in favor of venerating traditional Chinese culture and values.

The commercial determinants of health - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Maani, Nason","An accessible multidisciplinary overview for anyone seeking to understand the commercial determinants of health  Our health is largely shaped by the world around us--by the conditions in which we grow, work, and live. These conditions include the commercial determinants of health, the private sector activities which influence our physical and social environments, our available evidence and solutions, and even our discourse and understanding around key health and social issues.  Until recently, commercial determinants have remained largely absent from our conceptual understanding of the drivers of health. The scale of their potential impact necessitates a multidisciplinary and intersectional approach, but no book has yet explored the commercial impacts on health in their totality.  This pioneering volume sheds light on how commercial determinants shape health directly and indirectly through influencing policy, evidence, and discourse.

Composing violence : the limits of exposure and the making of minorities - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Chatterjee, Moyukh, 1983-","""In 2002, armed Hindu mobs attacked Muslims in broad daylight in the west Indian state of Gujarat. The pogrom, which was widely seen over television, left over one thousand dead. In Composing Violence Moyukh Chatterjee examines how highly visible political violence against minorities acts as a catalyst for radical changes in law, public culture, and power. He shows that, far from being quashed through its exposure by activists, media and politicians, state-sanctioned anti-Muslim violence set the stage for transforming India into a Hindu supremacist state. The state and civil society's responses to the violence, Chatterjee contends, reveal the constitutive features of modern democracy in which riots and pogroms are techniques to produce a form of society based on a killable minority and a triumphant majority. Focusing on courtroom procedures, police archives, legal activism, and mainstream media coverage, Chatterjee theorizes violence as a form of governance that creates minority populations. By tracing the composition of anti-Muslim violence and the legal structures that transform that violence into the making of minorities and majorities, Chatterjee demonstrates that violence is intrinsic to liberal democracy"" --Provided by publisher.","Durham : Duke University Press, 2023.",English,,Includes bibliographical references and index.,"xiii, 166 pages : illustrations ; 24 cm.",,,1330195641.0,LCCN: 2022036266^^British national bibliography: GBC2L8765,010787177,"Moyukh Chatterjee examines how highly visible political violence against minorities acts as a catalyst for radical changes in law, public culture, and power.

Concrete Structures Deteriorated by Delayed Ettringite Formation and Alkali-Silica Reactions - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Azevedo, António C.","This book discusses the behaviour of isolated concrete bottle-shaped struts affected by internal expansion reactions (ISR). For that purpose, the numerical modelling of damaged concrete was performed using the Concrete Damaged Plasticity Model (CDPM) implemented in ABAQUS and validated the model through Sankovich's tests. A procedure to automatically obtain the concrete plasticity and damage parameters, essential for CDPM, was developed in Matlab. The inputs were the characteristic compressive strength of the concrete, the equivalent length of the finite element mesh and the ratio between the plastic and inelastic compressive strains. The results showed that the CDPM could represent the load-bearing mechanisms of isolated concrete bottle-shaped struts for a range of several stress levels to which these elements may be subjected in the panels investigated. The numerical simulations for different expansion levels consistently captured the expected damage profile of the panels and the load corresponding to the formation of the first crack, the estimated crack opening, and the ultimate load. For the panels investigated, the reduction observed in the failure load reached values close to 70%, the increase of the tensile plastic deformation was more than 60%, and the maximum crack opening can reach an increase of 113% when compared with those observed experimentally in panels without internal swelling reactions The book also offers a systematic review of the current state of knowledge and it is a valuable resource for scientists, students, practitioners, and lecturers in various scientific and engineering disciplines, namely, civil and materials engineering, as well as and other interested parties.","Cham : Springer International Publishing : Imprint: Springer, 2023.",English,,,"1 online resource (VIII, 88 p. 59 illus., 44 illus. in color.) online resource.",File type: text fileFile format: PDF,,,DOI: 10.1007/978-3-031-12267-5,010854011,"Concrete Structures Deteriorated by Delayed Ettringite Formation and Alkali-Silica Reactions - Duke University Libraries Catalog.

Her life ran parallel to the front lines of history yet her influence on 20th century America, from the New Deal to the Cold War and beyond, has never before been told.   As Franklin Delano Roosevelt's special envoy to Europe in World War II she went where the president couldn't go. She was among the first Allied women to enter a liberated concentration camp, and stood in the Eagle's Nest, Hitler's mountain retreat, days after its capture. She guided the direction of the G.I. Bill of Rights and the Manhattan Project. Though Anna Rosenberg emerged from modest immigrant beginnings, equipped with only a high school education, she was the real power behind national policies critical to America winning the war and prospering afterward. Astonishingly, her story remains largely forgotten.  With a disarming mix of charm and Tammany-hewn toughness, Rosenberg began her career in public relations in 1920s Manhattan. She became friends with Eleanor Roosevelt, who recommended Anna to her husband, who was then running for Governor of New York. As FDR's unofficial adviser, Rosenberg soon wielded enormous influence--no less potent for being subtle. Roosevelt dubbed her ""my Mrs. Fix-It."" Her extraordinary career continued after his death.  By 1950, she was tapped to become the assistant secretary of defense--the highest position ever held by a woman in the US military--prompting Senator Joe McCarthy to wage an unsuccessful smear campaign against her. In 1962, she organized John F. Kennedy's infamous birthday gala, sitting beside him while Marilyn Monroe sang. Until the end of her life, Rosenberg fought tirelessly for causes from racial integration to women's equality to national health care.  More than the story of one remarkable woman, The Confidante explores who gets to be at the forefront of history, and why. Though she was not quite a hidden figure, Rosenberg's position as ""the power behind,"" combined with her status as an immigrant and a Jewish woman, served to diminish her importance. In this inspiring, impeccably researched, and revelatory book, Christopher C. Gorham at last affords Anna Rosenberg the recognition she so richly deserves.

Conjuring the Buddha : ritual manuals in early Tantric Buddhism - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Dalton, Jacob Paul","Ritual manuals are among the most common and most personal forms of Buddhist literature. Since at least the late fifth century, individual practitioners-including monks, nuns, teachers, disciples, and laypeople-have kept texts describing how to perform the daily rites. These manuals represent an intimate counterpart to the canonical sutras and the tantras, speaking to the lived experience of Buddhist practice.  Conjuring the Buddha offers a history of early tantric Buddhist ritual through the lens of the Tibetan manuscripts discovered near Dunhuang on the ancient Silk Road. Jacob P. Dalton argues that the spread of ritual manuals offered Buddhists an extracanonical literary form through which to engage with their tradition in new and locally specific ways. He suggests that ritual manuals were the literary precursors to the tantras, crucial to the emergence of esoteric Buddhism. Examining a series of ninth- and tenth-century tantric manuals from Dunhuang, Dalton uncovers lost moments in the development of rituals such as consecration, possession, sexual yoga, the Great Perfection, and the subtle body practices of the winds and channels. He also traces the use of poetic language in ritual manuals, showing how at pivotal moments, metaphor, simile, rhythm, and rhyme were deployed to evoke carefully sculpted affective experiences.

Consent in the presence of force : sexual violence and Black women's survival in antebellum New Orleans - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Owens, Emily A.","In histories of enslavement and in Black women's history, coercion looms large in any discussion of sex and sexuality. At a time when sexual violence against Black women was virtually unregulated--even normalized--a vast economy developed specifically to sell the sexual labor of Black women. In this vividly rendered book, Emily A. Owens wrestles with the question of why white men paid notoriously high prices to gain sexual access to the bodies of enslaved women to whom they already had legal and social access.    Owens centers the survival strategies and intellectual labor of Black women enslaved in New Orleans to unravel the culture of violence they endured, in which slaveholders obscured ""the presence of force"" with arrangements that included gifts and money. Owens's storytelling highlights that the classic formulation of rape law that requires ""the presence of force"" and ""the absence of consent"" to denote a crime was in fact a key legal fixture that packaged predation as pleasure and produced , rather than prevented, violence against Black women. Owens dramatically reorients our understanding of enslaved women's lives as well as of the nature of violence in the entire venture of racial slavery in the U.S. South. Unsettling the idea that consent is necessarily incompatible with structural and interpersonal violence, this history shows that when sex is understood as a transaction, women are imagined as responsible for their own violation.","Chapel Hill : The University of North Carolina Press, [2023]",English,,Includes bibliographical references and index.,"1 online resource (1 volume) : illustrations, maps.",,,,,010745489,"Emily A.

Conservation translocations - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Gaywood, Martin J.","Conservation translocation - the movement of species for conservation benefit - includes reintroducing species into the wild, reinforcing dwindling populations, helping species shift ranges in the face of environmental change, and moving species to enhance ecosystem function. Conservation translocation can lead to clear conservation benefits and can excite and engage a broad spectrum of people. However, these projects are often complex and involve careful consideration and planning of biological and socio-economic issues. This volume draws on the latest research and experience of specialists from around the world to help provide guidance on best practice and to promote thinking over how conservation translocations can continue to be developed. The key concepts cover project planning, biological and social factors influencing the efficacy of translocations, and how to deal with complex decision-making.

"Consuming the body : capitalism, social media and commodification - Duke University Libraries Catalog",,"Woolley, Dawn","Consuming the Body examines contemporary consumerism and the commodified construction of ideal gendered bodies, paying particular attention to the new forms of interaction produced by social networking sites. Describing the behaviours of an ideal neoliberal subject, Woolley identifies modes of discipline, forms of pleasure, and opportunities for subversion in an examination of how individuals are addressed and the ways in which they are expected to respond. Key modes of address that compel the consumer to consume are: sadistic commands communicated in adverts, TV programmes and magazine articles; a fetishistic gaze that dissects the body into parts to be improved through commodification; and a hystericized insistent presence that compels the consumer to present their body for critique and appreciation that is exemplified in the selfie.  Woolley interprets the visual characteristics of different types of selfies, including #fitspiration, #thinspiration, #fatspiration, and #bodypositivity to understand how they relate to current body ideals. Healthism and culture bound illnesses such as hysteria and eating disorders are examined to demonstrate the impact of commodified body ideals on consumers' bodies. An analysis of thinspiration images (photographs of emaciated bodies shared on pro-eating-disorder blogs and websites) suggests that the anorexic body represents the logical (and fatal) end point for the idealised body in consumer culture. Fat acceptance selfies suggest there is a fourth mode of address, empowering presence that has the potential to liberate consumers from the 'trap of visibleness' produced by the other three modes of address. In conclusion, the book identifies some creative methods for producing selfies that evade commoditisation and discipline.","London, UK ; New York, NY : Bloomsbury Visual Arts, 2023.©2023",English,,Includes bibliographical references (pages 177-192) and index.,"x, 196 pages : illustrations (black and white) ; 24 cm",,,1338676374.0,British national bibliography: GBC2D5310,010858769,"Consuming the Body examines contemporary consumerism and the commodified construction of ideal gendered bodies.

"Contemporary Israeli cinema : trauma, ethics and temporality - Duke University Libraries Catalog",,"Yosef, Raz, 1967-","""Through analysis of the complex discourse surrounding trauma and loss, this book provides a necessary examination of temporality and ethics in Israeli film and television since the turn of the millennium.

Maintaining that contemporary Israeli cinema has undergone an ethical shift, the author examines the revealing traumas and denied identities that also seek alternative ways to confront ethical question of accountability. It discusses the relationships between trauma, nationalism, and cinema through the intertwined perspectives of feminism, queer theory, and critical race and postcolonial studies, showing how national traumas are constructed by notions of gendered, sexual, and racial identity.

"Contemporary issues in Islamic law, economics and finance : a multidisciplinary approach - Duke University Libraries Catalog",,"Cortelezzi, Flavia, 1974-","This book explores how Islam can impact the structures and performance of firms, financial institutions and capital markets across a range of countries and industries.The Islamic finance industry represents an important reality not only because of the oil wealth of the Gulf states, which have fueled demand for such financial services, but also for an increased demand from a growing Muslim population in the West that aspires to express a full and all-inclusive religious identity. The increased demand for Muslim financial institutions has prompted Western non-Islamic firms to begin providing these services in an interesting effort of acculturation to the new plural scenario.By adopting a multidisciplinary approach, which also takes into account the theological, legal and geopolitical framework, the book offers a comprehensive picture of Islamic financial tools, contracts and business opportunities. Drawing on different fields of expertise, it deals with various themes, such as the theological roots of Islamic economics and finance and its geopolitical impact; the EU policy of cooperation with MENA and GCC countries; the instruments of Islamic finance, its legal principle and ability to become an instrument for enhancing business opportunities; the functioning of Islamic banks; the development of capital markets within a financial model influenced by religious constraints and, finally, the new relationships of this religious financial system with Western legal systems. The book thus provides a complete and extensive overview of the practice of Islamic finance through the lenses offered by studies of economics and management.Providing a careful analysis and an integrated framework of geo-economic and political issues, the book will be a valuable resource for academics, researchers and professionals in International Business, Entrepreneurship and Small Business Management, Law and Religion and Intercultural Studies.

Chapters from across both the Global South and North consider emerging formations of citizenship and citizen identities among children and youth in formal and non-formal education contexts, as well as the social and civic imaginaries and practices to which children and youth engage, both in and outside of schools.Rich empirical contributions from an international team of contributors call attention to the social, political, economic, and educational structures shaping the ways young people view citizenship and highlight the social and political agency of children and youth amid increasing issues of polarization, climate change, conflict, migration, extremism, and authoritarianism. The book ultimately identifies emergent forms of citizenship developing in formal and non-formal educational contexts, including those that unsettle the nation-state and democracy.Edited by a team of academics with backgrounds in education, citizenship, and youth studies, this book will appeal to scholars, researchers, and faculty who work across the broader field of youth civic engagement and democracy, as well as international and comparative education and citizenship.The Open Access version of this book, available at www.taylorfrancis.com, has been made available under a Creative Commons Attribution-Non Commercial-No Derivatives 4.0 license.

"Contested representation : challenges, shortcomings, and reforms - Duke University Libraries Catalog",,"Landwehr, Claudia","In the past two decades, democratic institutions have faced a crisis of representation. From authoritarian backsliding in countries with recent democratic transformations, to severe challenges to established liberal democracies, the meaning of political representation and whether and when it succeeds has become highly debated.

Taking an interdisciplinary, comparative approach, this volume looks at the viability of electoral institutions, the responsiveness of government to public preferences, alternative institutions for more inclusive democracy, and the political economy of populism.

Contesting Languages : Heteroglossia and the Politics of Language in the Early Church - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Tupamahu, Ekaputra","How did the Apostle Paul navigate the language differences in Corinth? In Contesting Languages: Heteroglossia and the Politics of Language in the Early Church, Ekaputra Tupamahu investigates Corinthian tongue-speech as a site of political struggle. Tupamahu demonstrates that conceptualizing speaking in tongues as ecstatic, unintelligible expressions is an interpretive invention of German romantic-nationalist scholarship. Instead, drawing on Mikhail Bakhtin's theories of language, Tupamahu finds two forces of language at work in the New Testament: a centripetalizing force of monolingualism, which attempts to force heterogeneous languages into a singular linguistic form, and a countervailing centrifugal force that diverse languages unleash.  The city of Corinth in the Roman period was a multilingual city-a sociolinguistic context that Tupamahu argues should be taken seriously when reading Paul's directives concerning Corinthians ""speaking in tongues"". Grounding his reading of the texts in the experiences of immigrants who speak minority languages, Tupamahu reads Paul's prohibition against the use of tongues in public gathering as a form of cultural domination. This book offers a competing social imagination, in which tongues as a heteroglossic phenomenon promises a radically hospitable space and a new socio-linguistic vision marked by unending difference.","[Place of publication not identified] : Oxford University Press USA, 2023.",,,Title from content provider.,1 online resource,,,,,010758890,In Contesting Languages: Heteroglossia and the Politics of Language in the Early Church.

Continental reckoning : the American West in the age of expansion - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"West, Elliott, 1945-","In Continental Reckoning renowned historian Elliott West presents a sweeping narrative of the American West and its vital role in the transformation of the nation. In the 1840s, by which time the United States had expanded to the Pacific, what would become the West was home to numerous vibrant Native cultures and vague claims by other nations. Thirty years later it was organized into states and territories and bound into the nation and world by an infrastructure of rails, telegraph wires, and roads and by a racial and ethnic order, with its Indigenous peoples largely dispossessed and confined to reservations.    Unprecedented exploration uncovered the West's extraordinary resources, beginning with the discovery of gold in California within days of the United States acquiring the territory following the Mexican-American War. As those resources were developed, often by the most modern methods and through modern corporate enterprise, half of the contiguous United States was physically transformed. Continental Reckoning guides the reader through the rippling, multiplying changes wrought in the western half of the country, arguing that these changes should be given equal billing with the Civil War in this crucial transition of national life.    As the West was acquired, integrated into the nation, and made over physically and culturally, the United States shifted onto a course of accelerated economic growth, a racial reordering and redefinition of citizenship, engagement with global revolutions of science and technology, and invigorated involvement with the larger world. The creation of the West and the emergence of modern America were intimately related. Neither can be understood without the other. With masterful prose and a critical eye, West presents a fresh approach to the dawn of the American West, one of the most pivotal periods of American history.","Lincoln : University of Nebraska Press, [2023]",English,,Includes bibliographical references and index.,1 online resource (pages cm.) :,File type: text file,,,,010763427,"Elliott West presents a sweeping narrative of the American West and its vital role in the transformation of the nation.

"Contraception and modern Ireland : a social history, c.1922-92 - Duke University Libraries Catalog",,"Kelly, Laura, 1986-","Contraception was the subject of intense controversy in twentieth-century Ireland. Banned in 1935 and stigmatised by the Catholic Church, it was the focus of some of the most polarised debates before and after its legalisation in 1979. This is the first comprehensive, dedicated history of contraception in Ireland from the establishment of the Irish Free State in 1922 to the 1990s. Drawing on the experiences of Irish citizens through a wide range of archival sources and oral history, Laura Kelly provides insights into the lived experiences of those negotiating family planning, alongside the memories of activists who campaigned for and against legalisation. She highlights the influence of the Catholic Church's teachings and legal structures on Irish life showing how, for many, sex and contraception were obscured by shame.

"Cooling the tropics : ice, indigeneity, and Hawaiian refreshment - Duke University Libraries Catalog",,"Hobart, Hiʻilei Julia","""Beginning in the mid-1800s, Americans hauled frozen pond water, then glacial ice, and then ice machines to Hawai'i-all in an effort to reshape the islands in the service of Western pleasure and profit. Marketed as ""essential"" for white occupants of the nineteenth-century Pacific, ice quickly permeated the foodscape through advancements in freezing and refrigeration technologies. In Cooling the Tropics Hiʻilei Julia Kawehipuaakahaopulani Hobart charts the social history of ice in Hawai'i to show how the interlinked concepts of freshness and refreshment mark colonial relationships to the tropics.

Copyright's broken promise : how to restore the law's ability to promote the progress of science - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Willinsky, John, 1950-","A comprehensive proposal for reforming copyright law to ensure sustainable public access to research and scholarship.   Open access is widely supported by researchers, librarians, scholarly societies, and research funders, as well as large and small publishers. Yet despite this support-and the pandemic's demonstration of the importance of open access for scientific progress-the scholarly publishing market is failing to deliver open access quickly enough. In Copyright's Broken Promise , John Willinsky presents the case for reforming copyright law so that it supports, rather than impedes, public access to research and scholarship. He draws on the legal strategy of statutory licensing to set out the terms and structures by which the Copyright Act could ensure that publishers are fairly compensated for providing immediate open access.  What sets Willinsky's analysis apart is its focus on the current state of scholarly publishing. Because copyright offers so little legal support for moving publishing to open access, though it is best for science, he says it is time to stop regarding the Copyright Act as a law of nature that can only be circumvented, contravened, or temporarily set aside. Specifically, he proposes that the Copyright Act add a new category of work, called ""research publications,"" which would be subject to statutory licensing. This would allow publishers to receive royalty payments from the principal institutional users (universities, industry R&D, research institutes, and so on) and sponsors of the work (foundations and government agencies), while providing immediate open access.","Cambridge, Massachusetts : Massachusetts Institute of Technology, [2023]",English,,Description based on print version record.Includes bibliographical references and index.,1 online resource (pages cm),File type: text file,,,LCCN: 2022003112,010746967,"In Copyright's Broken Promise, John Willinsky presents the case for reforming copyright law to ensure sustainable public access to research and scholarship.

Cosserat plate theory - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Steinberg, Lev","This book presents the foundation and validation of the Cosserat Plate Theory, numerical experiments of deformation and vibration, and the unique properties of the Cosserat plates.

The Cosserat Plate Theory is parametric, where the ""splitting parameter"" minimizes the Cosserat plate energy. The validation of the theory is based on the comparison with the three-dimensional Cosserat Elastostatics and Elastodynamics. The numerical results are obtained using the Finite Element Method (FEM) specifically developed to solve the parametric system of equations.

Counseling women : kinship against violence in India - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Kowalski, Julia, 1983-","Women's rights activists around the world have commonly understood gendered violence as the product of so-called traditional family structures, from which women must be liberated. Counseling Women contends that this perspective overlooks the social and cultural contexts in which women understand and navigate their relationships with kin.  This book follows frontline workers in India, called family counselors, as they support women who have experienced violence at home in the context of complex shifting legal and familial systems. Drawing on ethnographic research at counseling centers in Jaipur, Rajasthan, Julia Kowalski shows how an individualistic notion of women's rights places already vulnerable women into even more precarious positions by ignoring the reality of the social relations that shape lives within and beyond the family. Thus, rather than focusing on attaining independence from kin, family counselors in India instead strive to help women cultivate relationships of interdependence in order to reimagine family life in the wake of violence. Counselors mobilize the beliefs, concepts, and frameworks of kinship to offer women interactive strategies to gain agency within the family, including multigenerational kin networks encompassing parents, in-laws, and other extended family. Through this work, kinship becomes a resource through which people imagine and act on new familial futures.  In viewing this reliance on kinship as part of, rather than a deviation from, global women's rights projects, Counseling Women reassesses Western liberal feminism's notions of what it means to have agency and what constitutes violence, and retheorizes the role of interdependence in gendered violence and inequality as not only a site of vulnerability but a potential source of strength.","Philadelphia : University of Pennsylvania Press, [2023]",English,,Includes bibliographical references and index.,1 online resource ( 241 p.) :,Color characteristics: polychromeFile type: text file,Electronic books,,,010711929,"Julia Kowalski's book follows frontline workers in India, called family counselors, as they support women who have experienced violence at home in the context of complex shifting legal and familial systems.

The COVID-19 pandemic and the future of working spaces - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Mariotti, Ilaria, 1973-","This edited volume presents a compendium of emerging and innovative studies on the proliferation of new working spaces (NeWSps), both formal and informal (such as coworking spaces, maker spaces, fab labs, public libraries, and coffee shops), and their role during and following the COVID-19 pandemic in urban and regional development and planning. This book presents an original, interdisciplinary approach to NeWSps through three features: (i) situating the debate in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has transformed NeWSp business models and the everyday work life of their owners and users; (ii) repositioning and rethinking the debate on NeWSps in the context of socioeconomics and planning and comparing conditions between before and during the COVID-19 pandemic; and (iii) providing new directions for urban and regional development and resilience to the COVID-19 pandemic, considering new ways of working and living. The 17 chapters are co-authored by both leading international scholars who have studied the proliferation of NeWSps in the last decade and young, talented researchers, resulting in a total of 55 co-authors from different disciplines (48 of whom are currently involved in the COST Action CA18214 'The Geography of New Working Spaces and Impact on the Periphery' 2019-2023: www.new-working-spaces.eu).

CREATIVE HUSTLING : WOMEN MAKING AND DISTRIBUTING FILMS FROM NAIROBI. - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"STEEDMAN, ROBIN","The first book-length study of Nairobi-based female filmmakers--and how their dogged pursuit of opportunities, innovation, and cultural support is defining an industry.   Nairobi, the capital of Kenya, is home to something extraordinary and unlikely: in this city, the most critically acclaimed filmmakers--both directors and producers--are women. Yet, across the globe, women make up less than 10 percent of film directors. In Creative Hustling , Robin Steedman takes a closer look at these remarkable women filmmakers, viewing them not only as auteurs, but also as entrepreneurs, who are taking the lead in creating a vibrant, and atypical, screen media industry. To understand their achievement, Steedman theorizes hustling as not only a practice born out of necessity but also an inventive labor in its own right--one that can create new spaces of community by carving new entrepreneurial pathways.  Through original empirical field research gathered over eight months in Nairobi, Steedman describes how female filmmakers go about trying to create their films, as well as the challenges they face in distributing those films in their local market. Along the way, she traces the history of the industry over the last fifteen years, the lack of state support for these filmmakers' undertakings, the low social standing of the profession, and the transnational conflicts that arise when Euro-American funding is at the heart of Kenyan cinema.  Creative Hustling is a major contribution to the task of de-Westernizing media industry studies, imparting important lessons about what it takes to create and distribute creative work in a global age increasingly marked by uncertain work.",CAMBRIDGE MIT PRESS 2023,,,,,,,,,010858651,"The first book-length study of Nairobi-based female filmmakers.

CRISIS OF DEMOCRATIC CAPITALISM. - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Wolf, Martin","From the chief economics commentator of the Financial Times , a magnificent reckoning with how and why the marriage between democracy and capitalism is coming undone, and what can be done to reverse this terrifying dynamic   Martin Wolf has long been one of the wisest voices on global economic issues. He has rarely been called an optimist, yet he has never been as worried as he is today. Liberal democracy is in recession, and authoritarianism is on the rise. The ties that ought to bind open markets to free and fair elections are threatened, even in democracy's heartlands, the United States and England. Around the world, powerful voices argue that capitalism is better without democracy; others argue that democracy is better without capitalism. This book is a forceful rejoinder to both views. Even as it offers a deep, lucid assessment of why this marriage has grown so strained, it makes clear why a divorce of capitalism from democracy would be a calamity for the world. They need each other even if they find it hard to life together. For all its flaws, argues Wolf, democratic capitalism remains far and away the best system for human flourishing. But something has gone seriously awry: the growth of prosperity has slowed, and the division of its fruits between the hypersuccessful few and the rest has become more unequal. The plutocrats have retreated to their bastions, where they pour scorn on government's ability to invest in the public goods needed to foster opportunity and sustainability. But the incoming flood of autocracy will rise to overwhelm them, too, in the end. Citizenship is not just a slogan or a romantic idea; it's the only idea that can save us, Wolf argues. Nothing has ever harmonized political and economic freedom better than a shared faith in the common good. This wise and rigorously fact-based exploration of the epic story of the dynamic between democracy and capitalism concludes with the lesson that our ideals and our interests not only should align, but must do so, for everyone's sake.

A critical companion to Terry Gilliam - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Planka, Sabine","A Critical Companion to Terry Gilliam provides a fresh, up-to-date exploration of the director's films and artistic practices, ranging from his first film Monty Python and the Holy Grail (1975) to his recently released and latest film The Man Who Killed Don Quixote (2018).

Critical Legal Education As a Subversive Activity - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Duffy, Mark","In an age when everyone aspires to teach critical thinking skills in the classroom, what does it mean to be a subversive law teacher? Who or what might a subversive law teacher seek to subvert - the authority of the law, the university, their own authority as teachers, perhaps? Are law students ripe for subversion, agents of, or impediments to, subversion? Do they learn to ask critical questions? Responding to the provocation in the classic book Teaching as a Subversive Activity, by Postman and Weingartner, the idea that teaching could, or even should, be subversive still holds true today, and its premise is particularly relevant in the context of legal education. We therefore draw on this classic book to discuss, in the present volume, the consideration of research into legal education as lifetime learning, as creating meaning, as transformative and as developing world-changing thinking within the legal context. The volume offers research into classroom experiences and theoretical and historical interrogations of what it means to teach law subversively. Primarily aimed at legal educators and doctoral students in law planning careers as academics, its insights speak directly to tensions in higher education more broadly.","[Place of publication not identified] : Taylor & Francis (Unlimited), 2023.",,,Title from content provider.,1 online resource,,,,,010762071,"Critical Legal Education As a Subversive Activity by Postman and Weingartner.

For example, the Boasian/UNESCO strategy that highlights biology's rejection of race neglects cultural racism. Drawing on the work of Frantz Fanon, the late Sartre, and Michel Foucault, Robert Bernasconi argues for a holistic approach that integrates the concreteexperience of racism faced by individuals into the study of institutional, structural, and systemic racism.

Critical race studies in physical education - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Blackshear, Tara B., 1972-","Racism is a sickness that permeates every aspect of Black life. But if the events of the past few years have taught us anything, it is that America has a hard time talking about issues that create disparity and inequality for Black people.    This inequality extends not just into education but also into physical education. Blacks are stereotyped as physically superior and intellectually deficient. They are marginalized in PE just as they are in other aspects of their lives.    Through a series of case studies, Critical Race Studies in Physical Education offers deep insights into the issues that Black students face. The text, geared to undergraduate and graduate PETE students and in-service teachers, does the following: Provides culturally aware teaching strategies that affirm the worth of Black students Amplifies the crucial issues that negatively affect Black students Addresses the litany of intentional and covert racist practices directed toward Black youth, thus broadening the book's value beyond the sharing of teaching strategies The end goal is to elevate the perspectives of Black youths and teachers and to normalize positive experiences for Black students in physical education.    To do so, Critical Race Studies in Physical Education provides the following: Eight case studies of situations that expose racism, disparities, and other issues affecting Black students' well-being, self-worth, and healthy experiences in PE Critical race study discourse that stimulates discussion of relevant issues and enhances learning Reflective activities, resources, lesson considerations, and definitions to help students and in-service teachers use what they have learned through the case studies and discussions   Each case study includes discussion and reflection prompts that are meant to lead the way to effective strategies and immediate implementation opportunities. Here is a partial list of the case studies: A white elementary student uses the N-word toward a Black teacher A Black female student endures gendered racism and racial disparities through her swimming experiences A white teacher is oblivious to why her Black students don't want to be outside in the sunshine or get their hair moist A new PE teacher harbors toxic masculinity, white supremacy, and stereotypes of Black sexuality White student teachers grapple with accepting job offers in an urban area   Black students need teachers to engage in anti-racist teaching practices that empower Black youth and aid in their success. For this to happen, teachers need to affirm students and make them feel safe, cared for, listened to, and recognized as worthy.    Critical Race Studies in Physical Education will help teachers of all races adopt the teaching practices that create this supportive, empathetic, and nurturing environment--and, in doing so, validate Black students' self-worth and swing the pendulum back toward a more equitable education in PE.","Champaign, IL : Human Kinetics, Inc., [2023]©2023",English,,Includes bibliographical references.,"xxix, 106 pages : illustrations ; 23 cm",,,1272882964.0,LCCN: ^^2021043412British national bibliography: GBC231571,010603111,"Critical Race Studies in Physical Education offers deep insights into issues that Black students face.

"CROOKED, BUT NEVER COMMON : THE FILMS OF PRESTON STURGES. - Duke University Libraries Catalog",,"KLAWANS, STUART","In a burst of creativity unmatched in Hollywood history, Preston Sturges directed a string of all-time classic comedies from 1939 through 1948-- The Great McGinty , The Lady Eve , Sullivan's Travels , The Palm Beach Story , and The Miracle of Morgan's Creek among them--all from screenplays he alone had written. Cynical and sophisticated, romantic and sexually frank, crazily breakneck and endlessly witty, his movies continue to influence filmmakers and remain popular to this day. Yet despite this acclaim, Sturges's achievements remain underappreciated: he is too often categorized as a dialogue writer and plot engineer more than a director, or belittled as an irresponsible spinner of laughs.

Cult of Stephen in Jerusalem : Inventing a Patron Martyr - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Méndez, Hugo","As the site of only a small and obscure Christian population between 135 and 313 CE, Jerusalem witnessed few instances of anti-Christian persecution. This fact became a source of embarrassment to the city in late antiquity--a period when martyr traditions, relics, and shrines were closely intertwined with local prestige. At that time, the city had every incentive to stretch the fame of its few, apostolic martyrs as far as possible-especially the fame of the biblical St. Stephen, the figure traditionally regarded as the first Christian martyr (Acts 6-8). What the church lacked in the quantity of its martyrs, it believed it could compensate for in an exclusive, local claim to the figure widely hailed as the ""Protomartyr"", ""firstborn of the martyrs"", and ""chief of confessors"" in contemporary sources. This book traces the rise of the cult of Stephen in Jerusalem, exploring such historical episodes as the fabrication of his relics, the construction of a grand basilica in his honour, and the multiplication of the saint's feast days. It argues that local church authorities promoted devotion to Stephen in the fifth century in a conscious attempt to position him as a patron saint for Jerusalem--that is, a symbolic embodiment of the city's Christian identity and power.","[Place of publication not identified] : Oxford University Press USA, 2023.",,,Title from content provider.,1 online resource,,,,,010758927,"This book traces the rise of the cult of St. Stephen in Jerusalem.

"Cultivating empire : capitalism, philanthropy, and the negotiation of American imperialism in Indian country - Duke University Libraries Catalog",,"Daggar, Lori J.","Cultivating Empire charts the connections between missionary work, capitalism, and Native politics to understand the making of the American empire in the late-eighteenth and early-nineteenth centuries. It presents American empire-building as a negotiated phenomenon that was built upon the foundations of earlier Atlantic empires, and it shows how U.S. territorial and economic development went hand-in-hand. Lori. J. Daggar explores how Native authority and diplomatic protocols encouraged the fledgling U.S. federal government to partner with missionaries in the realm of Indian affairs, and she charts how that partnership borrowed and deviated from earlier imperial-missionary partnerships.  Employing the terminology of speculative philanthropy to underscore the ways in which a desire to do good often coexisted with a desire to make profit, Cultivating Empire links eighteenth- and early-nineteenth-century U.S. Indian policy--often framed as benevolent by its crafters--with the emergence of racial capitalism in the United States. In the process, Daggar argues that Native peoples wielded ideas of philanthropy and civilization for their own purposes and that Indian Country played a critical role in the construction of the U.S. imperial state and its economy. Rather than understand civilizing missions simply as tools for assimilation, then, Cultivating Empire reveals that missions were hinges for U.S. economic and political development that could both devastate Indigenous communities and offer Native peoples additional means to negotiate for power and endure.","Philadelphia : University of Pennsylvania Press, [2023]",English,,Includes bibliographical references and index.,"1 online resource ( viii, 254 pages) : illustrations, maps.",Color characteristics: polychromeFile type: text file,,,,010725484,"Lori.

Rather than understand civilizing missions simply as tools for assimilation, then, Cultivating Empire reveals that missions were hinges for U.S. economic and political development that could both devastate Indigenous communities and offer Native peoples additional means to negotiate for power and endure. J. Daggar explores how Native authority and diplomatic protocols encouraged the fledgling U.S. federal government to partner with missionaries in the realm of Indian affairs, and she charts how that partnership borrowed and deviated from earlier imperial-missionary partnerships. In the process, Daggar argues that Native peoples wielded ideas of philanthropy and civilization for their own purposes and that Indian Country played a critical role in the construction of the U.S. imperial state and its economy.

The curse of the Somers : the secret history behind the U.S. Navy's most infamous mutiny - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Delgado, James P.","A detailed and riveting account of the U.S. Navy's greatest mutiny and its wide-ranging cultural and historical impactThe greatest controversy in the history of the U.S. Navy of the early American Republic was the revelation that the son of the Secretary of War had seemingly plotted a bloody mutiny that would have turned the U.S. brig Somers into a pirate ship. The plot discovered, he and his co-conspirators werehastily condemned and hanged at sea.The repercussions of those acts brought headlines, scandal, a fistfight at a cabinet meeting, a court martial, ruined lives, lost reputations, and tales of a haunted ship ""bound for the devil"" and lost tragically at sea with many of its crew. The ""Somers affair"" led to the founding of the U.S. NavalAcademy and it remains the Navy's only acknowledged mutiny in its history. The story also inspired Herman Melville's White-Jacket and Billy Budd. Others connected to the Somers included Commodore Perry, a relation and defender of the Somers' captain Mackenzie; James Fenimore Cooper, whose feud withthe captain, dating back to the War of 1812, resurfaced in his reportage of the affair; and Raphael Semmes, the Somers' last caption who later served in the Confederate Navy.The Curse of the Somers is a thorough recreation of this classic tale, told with the help of recently uncovered evidence. Written by a maritime historian and archaeologist who helped identify the long-lost wreck and subsequently studied its sunken remains, this is a timeless tale of life and deathat sea. James P.

The groundbreaking samples of the E-MUSP-1200. All these machines--and their weirder, wilder-sounding cousins--changed composition, recording, and performance habits forever. Their distinctive sounds and styles helped create new genres of music, like hip hop and EDM. But they altered every musical style, from mainstream pop to heavy metal to jazz. Dan LeRoy traces the drum machine from its low-tech beginnings in the Fifties and Sixties to its evolution in the Seventies and its ubiquity in the Eighties, when seemingly overnight, it infiltrated every genre of music. Drum machines put some drummers out of work, while keeping others on their toes. They anticipated virtually every musical trend of the last five decades: sequencing, looping, sampling, and all forms of digital music creation. But the personalities beneath those perfect beats make the story of drum machines a surprisingly human one--told here for the very first time.","New York : Bloomsbury Academic, 2023.©2023",English,,Includes index.,"xxiii, 301 pages ; 24 cm",,,1290380655.0,LCCN: 2022015196,010850732,"Dancing to the Drum Machine is a never-before-attempted history of what is perhaps the most controversial musical instrument ever invented.

Dark Energy - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,Cunillera,"This book addresses supergravity and supergravity-motivated effective field theories in the context of cosmological model building. Extracting information about quintessence from string theory has attracted much attention in the past few years. The question became more urgent very recently after the possibility of obtaining de Sitter space was called into question. Therefore, there is an interesting debate as to whether de Sitter space or, even, quintessence can be derived from a fundamental theory, string theory or otherwise. This is a very active field of research, and the topics covered in the book render this work very timely. Throughout the book, special care has been taken in demonstrating historical relevance of the field and describing the set of open questions motivating the state-of-the-art research. The first few chapters in each part provide a detailed review of standard perturbative and non-perturbative techniques in supergravity model building, as a way to prepare the reader for the more technical and original subsequent chapters. These early chapters also represent a self-contained review that would be useful for anyone planning to enter this challenging area of study. The subsequent chapters detail research in supergravity-motivated effective field theories, in the first part, and supergravity models, in the second part.   One of the important conclusions in this book is that modelling quintessence in perturbative string theory is at least as challenging as modelling de Sitter, placing the wider programme on a collision course with observations.","[Place of publication not identified] : Springer Nature Switzerland, 2023.",,,Title from content provider.,1 online resource,,,,,010854104,"This book addresses supergravity and supergravity-motivated effective field theories in the context of cosmological model building.

"Data driven : truckers, technology, and the new workplace surveillance - Duke University Libraries Catalog",,"Levy, Karen, 1981-","A behind-the-scenes look at how digital surveillance is affecting the trucking way of life   Long-haul truckers are the backbone of the American economy, transporting goods under grueling conditions and immense economic pressure. Truckers have long valued the day-to-day independence of their work, sharing a strong occupational identity rooted in a tradition of autonomy. Yet these workers increasingly find themselves under many watchful eyes. Data Driven examines how digital surveillance is upending life and work on the open road, and raises crucial questions about the role of data collection in broader systems of social control.  Karen Levy takes readers inside a world few ever see, painting a bracing portrait of one of the last great American frontiers. Federal regulations now require truckers to buy and install digital monitors that capture data about their locations and behaviors. Intended to address the pervasive problem of trucker fatigue by regulating the number of hours driven each day, these devices support additional surveillance by trucking firms and other companies. Traveling from industry trade shows to law offices and truck-stop bars, Levy reveals how these invasive technologies are reconfiguring industry relationships and providing new tools for managerial and legal control--and how truckers are challenging and resisting them.

The dead hand's grip : how long constitutions bind states - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Brown, Adam R.","In The Dead Hand's Grip, Adam R. Brown examines constitutional specificity--or length--as a new way to evaluate how different polities govern citizens and regulate themselves. As Brown shows, many states and nations bloat their constitutions with procedural and policy details that otherpolities leave to statutory or regulatory discretion. American state constitutions vary in length from under 9,000 to almost 400,000 words. Constitutional endurance has often provoked fears that the dead hand of the past may reach into the present; lengthy constitutions strengthen the dead hand'sgrip, binding states to a former generation's solutions to modern problems.Brown argues that excessive constitutional specificity restricts state discretion, with three major results. First, it compels states to rely more frequently on burdensome amendment procedures, increasing constitutional amendment rates. Second, it increases judicial invalidation rates as statesupreme courts enforce narrower limits on state action.

Brown examines constitutional specificity--or length--as a new way to evaluate how different polities govern citizens and regulate themselves. Brown argues that excessive constitutional specificity restricts state discretion. Long constitutions strengthen the dead hand's grip, binding states to a former generation's solutions to modern problems. In short, long constitutions hurt states, Brown argues, resulting in lower incomes, higher unemployment, greater inequality, and reduced policy innovativeness generally. In The Dead Hand's Grip, Brown writes.","As Brown shows, many states and nations bloat their constitutions with procedural and policy details that otherpolities leave to statutory or regulatory discretion. Constitutional endurance has often provoked fears that the dead hand of the past may reach into the present; lengthy constitutions strengthen the dead hand'sgrip, binding states to a former generation's solutions to modern problems.Brown argues that excessive constitutional specificity restricts state discretion, with three major results. Second, it increases judicial invalidation rates as statesupreme courts enforce narrower limits on state action.

Dead in Banaras - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Singh, Ravi Nandan","Ethnographies fatefully rely on chance encounters and mysteriously so such encounters come true. ""Dead in Banaras"" is an instance of just such a fateful chance encounter. In its inception, it set out to follow the 'dead' across multiple social locations of crematoria, hospital, morgue and theaghorashram, in order to assemble a contemporary moment in the funerary iconicity of the well known North Indian city of Banaras. The crematoria in plural because the open-air manual pyres and closed-door electric furnaces sit side by side within the symbolic inside of the city. The hospital andmorgue became chosen destinations because in the local moral world, the city is a medical metropolis anchored by a famed university hospital and storied through real life dramatic narratives of medical emergency, saving and untimely death. Aghorashram on the other hand as an urban Shaivite clinicand hermitage for sexual and reproductive cures works with funerary substances as pharmacopeia. Early on, while undertaking fieldwork, these funerary journeys of the' dead' had a chance encounter with the author's father's death in the city. The same set of places, thereafter, spoke through thesensory logic of the author's father's death. Dead in Banaras is, thus, both an ethnography of being in the dead centre of a city and an autobiographical funeral travelling (Shav Yatra) that narrates the city through a mourner's logic of using the pyre to illuminate the dead as amultiplicity.","[Place of publication not identified] : Oxford University Press, 2023.",,,Title from content provider.,1 online resource,,,,,010758961,"""Dead in Banaras"" is an ethnography of being in the dead centre of a city and an autobiographical funeral travelling (Shav Yatra) that narrates the city through a mourner's logic of using the pyre to illuminate the dead as amultiplicity.

Deep Energy Retrofit-Case Studies - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,Lohse,"This book describes results of research conducted with the goal of providing a framework, selected tools, and guidelines to significantly reduce energy use (by more than 50%) in government and public buildings. The scope of the book is limited to public buildings that were constructed before the 1980s with low internal loads (e.g., office buildings, dormitories, barracks, public housing, and educational buildings) and that were undergoing major renovation. The book contains description and analysis of 26 well-documented case studies from Europe (Austria, Denmark, Estonia, Germany, Ireland, Latvia, Montenegro, The Netherlands, and the UK) and the USA. After these data were collected, the case studies were analyzed with respect to energy use (before and after renovation), reasons for undertaking the renovation, co-benefits achieved, resulting cost-effectiveness, and the business models followed. Finally, ""lessons learned"" were compiled and compared.  Deep Energy Retrofit (DER) is a major building renovation project in which site energy use intensity (including plug loads) has been reduced by at least 50% from the pre-renovation baseline with a corresponding improvement in indoor environmental quality and comfort. Lessons learned from the case studies and experiences of the team clearly indicate that DER can be achieved with the application of ""bundles"" of a limited number of core technologies readily available on the market.

Deep time : a literary history - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Heringman, Noah","How the concept of ""deep time"" began as a metaphor used by philosophers, poets, and naturalists in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries   In this interdisciplinary book, Noah Heringman argues that the concept of ""deep time""--most often associated with geological epochs--began as a metaphorical language used by philosophers, poets, and naturalists of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries to explore the origins of life beyond the written record. Their ideas about ""the abyss of time"" created a way to think about the prehistoric before it was possible to assign dates to the fossil record. Heringman, examining stories about the deep past by visionary thinkers ranging from William Blake to Charles Darwin, challenges the conventional wisdom that the idea of deep time came forth fully formed from the modern science of geology. Instead, he argues, it has a rich imaginative history.  Heringman considers Johann Reinhold Forster and Georg Forster, naturalists on James Cook's second voyage around the world, who, inspired by encounters with Pacific islanders, connected the scale of geological time to human origins and cultural evolution; Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon, who drew on travel narrative, antiquarian works, and his own fieldwork to lay out the first modern geological timescale; Blake and Johann Gottfried Herder, who used the language of fossils and artifacts to promote ancient ballads and ""prehistoric song""; and Darwin's exploration of the reciprocal effects of geological and human time.

Heringman, examining stories about the deep past by visionary thinkers ranging from William Blake to Charles Darwin, challenges the conventional wisdom that the idea of deep time came forth fully formed from the modern science of geology."
Defensive relativism : the use of cultural relativism in international legal practice - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Cowell, Frederick","Defensive Relativism describes how governments around the world use cultural relativism in legal argument to oppose international human rights law. Defensive relativist arguments appear in international courts, at the committees established by human rights treaties, and at the United Nations Human Rights Council. The aim of defensive relativist arguments is to exempt a state from having to apply international human rights law, or to stop international human rights law evolving, because it would interfere with cultural traditions the state deems important. It is an everyday occurrence in international human rights law and defensive relativist arguments can be used by various types of states. The end goal of defensive relativism is to allow a state to appear human rights compliant while at the same time not implementing international human rights law. Drawing on a range of materials, such as state reports on the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) and cases from the European Court of Human Rights involving freedom of religion, this book provides a definitive survey of defensive relativism. Crucially, Frederick Cowell argues, defensive relativism is not about alternative practices of human rights law, or debates about the origins or legitimacy of human rights as a concept. Defensive relativism is instead a variety of tactical argument used by states to justify ignoring international human rights law. Yet, as Cowell concludes, defensive relativism can't be removed from the law, as it is a reflection of unresolved tensions about the nature of what it means for rights to be universal.","Philadelphia : University of Pennsylvania Press, [2023]©2023",English,,Includes bibliographical references (pages 295-308) and index.,"xi, 314 pages ; 24 cm.",,,1310038160.0,LCCN: 2022011658British national bibliography: GBC2E8519,010781763,"Governments around the world use cultural relativism in legal argument to oppose international human rights law.

Delivered under fire : Absalom Markland and freedom's mail - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Hooper, Candice Shy","During the Civil War his movements from battlefield to battlefield were followed in the North and in the South nearly as closely as those of generals, though he was not in the military. After the war, his swift response to Ku Klux Klan violence sparked passage of a landmark civil rights law, though he was not a politician. When he died in 1888 newspapers reported his death from coast to coast, yet he's unknown today. He was the man who delivered the most valuable ingredient in U.S. soldiers' fighting spirit during those terrible war years--letters between the front lines and the home front. He was Absalom Markland, special agent of the United States Post Office, and this is his first biography.    At the beginning of the Civil War, at the request of his childhood friend Ulysses S. Grant, Markland created the most efficient military mail system ever devised, and Grant gave him the honorary title of colonel. He met regularly with President Abraham Lincoln during the war and carried important messages between Lincoln and Generals Grant and William Tecumseh Sherman at crucial points in our nation's peril. When the Ku Klux Klan waged its reign of terror and intimidation after the Civil War, Markland's decisive action secured the executive powers President Grant needed to combat the Klan. Nearly every biography of Lincoln, Sherman, and Grant includes at least one footnote about Markland, but his important, sometimes daily interaction with them during and after the war has escaped modern notice, until now.

"Demarcating Japan : imperialism, islanders, and mobility, 1855-1884 - Duke University Libraries Catalog",,"Yamamoto, Takahiro (Writer on Japanese history)","Histories of remote islands around Japan are usually told through the prism of territorial disputes. In contrast, Takahiro Yamamoto contends that the transformation of the islands from ambiguous border zones to a territorialized space emerged out of multilateral power relations. Sakhalin, the Kuril Islands, Tsushima, the Bonin Islands, and the Ryukyu Islands became the subject of inter-imperial negotiations during the formative years of modern Japan as empires nudged each other to secure their status with minimal costs rather than fighting a territorial scramble. Based on multiarchival, multilingual research, Demarcating Japan argues that the transformation of border islands should be understood as an interconnected process, where inter-local referencing played a key role in the outcome: Japan's geographical expansion in the face of domineering Extra-Asian empires.  Underneath this multilateral process were the connections forged by individuals. Translators, doctors, traffickers, castaways, and indigenous hunters crisscrossed border regions and enacted violence, exchanged knowledge, and forged friendships.

"Democratic Backsliding in Africa? : Autocratization, Resilience, and Contention - Duke University Libraries Catalog",,"Arriola, Leonardo R.","This is an open access title available under the terms of a CC BY-NC 4.0 licence. It is free to read at Oxford Scholarship Online and offered as a free PDF download from OUP and selected open access locations.  Why have most African countries not achieved greater political liberalization? What explains the lack of progress toward the ideals of liberal democracy across the region? This book advances ongoing debates on democratic backsliding with specific reference to Africa. In examining how incumbent leaders in African countries attempt to contain societal pressures for greater democracy, the chapters explain how governments go beyond the standard tools of manipulation, such as electoral fraud and political violence, to keep democracy from unfolding in their countries. The book emphasizes two distinct strategies that governments frequently use to reinforce their hold on power - the legal system and the international system - but which remain overlooked in conventional analyses; it also documents how governments employ the law to limit the scope of action among citizens and civil society activists struggling to expand democratic liberties, including the use of constitutional provisions and the courts. The work further demonstrates how governments use their role in international relations to neutralize pressure from external actors, including sovereigntist claims against foreign intervention and selective implementation of donor-promoted policies. While pro-democracy actors can also employ these legal and international strategies to challenge incumbents, in some cases to prevent democratic backsliding, the book shows why and how incumbents have enjoyed institutional advantages when implementing these strategies through six country case studies of Ghana, Kenya, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.  Oxford Studies in African Politics and International Relations is a series for scholars and students working on African politics and International Relations and related disciplines. Volumes concentrate on contemporary developments in African political science, political economy, and International Relations, such as electoral politics, democratization, decentralization, the political impact of natural resources, the dynamics and consequences of conflict, and the nature of the continent's engagement with the East and West. Comparative and mixed methods work is particularly encouraged. Case studies are welcomed but should demonstrate the broader theoretical and empirical implications of the study and its wider relevance to contemporary debates. The series focuses on sub-Saharan Africa, although proposals that explain how the region engages with North Africa and other parts of the world are of interest.

The descent of the soul and the archaic : katábasis and depth psychology - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Bishop, Paul, 1967-","The Descent of the Soul and the Archaic explores the motif of kátabasis (a ""descent"" into an imaginal underworld) and the importance it held for writers from antiquity to the present, with an emphasis on its place in psychoanalytic theory.

The contributors explore ancient and modern notions of the self, as obtained through a ""descent"" to a deeper level of imaginal experience.

Instead, the focus is on analysis of the industry and its component parts from the viewpoints of construction economists and others seeking to understand the drivers and challenges that shape an area of economic activity that is a major contributor in all economies.The aim of this book is to provide an overview and discussion of several aspects of what makes construction tick. It is unlike other industry sectors in many ways, being project-based with often intense competition for work. Where the first book, Measuring Construction, focused on particular areas associated with quantifying various aspects of construction activity and the second, Accounting for Construction, looked more at how we record and report on construction activity, Describing Construction gives readers the views of experts in the field of how the construction industry is described, what its make-up is, it even asks the question: is construction a single industry? This book will change the way most readers understand the 'construction industry', whatever that may be, not from the point of view of visible on-site activities, but through a scientific approach to analysis and understanding of how projects, firms and various sectors of the industry work and how things are changing and may continue to change in future. It is essential reading for students and researchers in construction management, quantity surveying, architecture and engineering.

Design and Development of Model Predictive Primary Control of Micro Grids - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,Vidyasagar,"This book provides a design and development perspective MPC for micro-grid control, emphasizing step-by-step conversion of a nonlinear MPC to linear MPC preserving critical aspects of nonlinear MPC. The book discusses centralized and decentralized MPC control algorithms for a generic modern-day micro-grid consisting of vital essential constituents. It starts with the nonlinear MPC formulation for micro-grids. It also moves towards the linear time-invariant and linear time-variant approximations of the MPC for micro-grid control. The contents also discuss how the application of orthonormal special functions can improve computational complexity of MPC algorithms. It also highlights various auxiliary requirements like state estimator, disturbance compensator for robustness, selective harmonic eliminator for eliminating harmonics in the micro-grid, etc. These additional requirements are crucial for the successful online implementation of the MPC. In the end, the book shows how a well-designed MPC is superior in performance compared to the conventional micro-grid primary controllers discussed above. The key topics discussed in this book include - the detailed modeling of micro-grid components; operational modes in micro-grid and their control objectives; conventional micro-grid primary controllers; the importance of MPC as a micro-grid primary controller; understanding of MPC operation; nonlinear MPC formulation; linear approximations of MPC; application of special functions in the MPC formulation; and other online requirements for the MPC implementation. The examples in the book are available both from a calculation point of view and as MATLAB codes.

Design of Heuristic Algorithms for Hard Optimization : With Python Codes for the Travelling Salesman Problem - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Taillard, Éric D.","This open access book demonstrates all the steps required to design heuristic algorithms for difficult optimization. The classic problem of the travelling salesman is used as a common thread to illustrate all the techniques discussed. This problem is ideal for introducing readers to the subject because it is very intuitive and its solutions can be graphically represented. The book features a wealth of illustrations that allow the concepts to be understood at a glance. The book approaches the main metaheuristics from a new angle, deconstructing them into a few key concepts presented in separate chapters: construction, improvement, decomposition, randomization and learning methods. Each metaheuristic can then be presented in simplified form as a combination of these concepts. This approach avoids giving the impression that metaheuristics is a non-formal discipline, a kind of cloud sculpture. Moreover, it provides concrete applications of the travelling salesman problem, which illustrate in just a few lines of code how to design a new heuristic and remove all ambiguities left by a general framework.

Desire in the Iliad : The Force That Moves the Epic and Its Audience - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,Lesser,"This is the first study to examine desire in the Iliad in a comprehensive way, and to explain its relationship to the epic's narrative structure and audience reception. Rachel H. Lesser offers a new reading of the poem that shows how the characters' desires, especially those of the mortal hero Achilleus and the divine king Zeus, motivate plot and keep the audience engaged with the epic until and even beyond its end. The author argues that the characters' desires are primarily organized in narrative triangles that feature two parties in conflict over a third. A variety of desires animate these triangles, including sexual passion, longing for a lost loved one, yearning for lamentation, and aggressive desires for vengeance and status, and they are signified with terms such as eros, himeros, pothe, menos, thumos, boule, and eeldor, as well as through the epic's thematic emotions of grief and anger. Desire in the Iliad shows how the mortals' and gods' triangular desires together d and shape two Iliadic plots, the main plot of Achilleus' withdrawal from the fighting and then return to battle, and the ""superplot"" of the larger Trojan War story. The author also argues that these plots and their motivating desires arouse the listener's-or reader's-own corresponding desires: narrative desire to know and understand the Iliad's full story, sympathetic desire for characters' welfare, and empathetic passions, longings, and wishes.

"Determinants, Gröbner Bases and Cohomology - Duke University Libraries Catalog",,Bruns,"This book offers an up-to-date, comprehensive account of determinantal rings and varieties, presenting a multitude of methods used in their study, with tools from combinatorics, algebra, representation theory and geometry.  After a concise introduction to Gröbner and Sagbi bases, determinantal ideals are studied via the standard monomial theory and the straightening law. This opens the door for representation theoretic methods, such as the Robinson-Schensted-Knuth correspondence, which provide a description of the Gröbner bases of determinantal ideals, yielding homological and enumerative theorems on determinantal rings. Sagbi bases then lead to the introduction of toric methods. In positive characteristic, the Frobenius functor is used to study properties of singularities, such as F-regularity and F-rationality. Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity, an important complexity measure in commutative algebra and algebraic geometry, is introduced in the general setting of a Noetherian base ring and then applied to powers and products of ideals. The remainder of the book focuses on algebraic geometry, where general vanishing results for the cohomology of line bundles on flag varieties are presented and used to obtain asymptotic values of the regularity of symbolic powers of determinantal ideals. In characteristic zero, the Borel-Weil-Bott theorem provides sharper results for GL-invariant ideals. The book concludes with a computation of cohomology with support in determinantal ideals and a survey of their free resolutions.  Determinants, Gröbner Bases and Cohomology provides a unique reference for the theory of determinantal ideals and varieties, as well as an introduction to the beautiful mathematics developed in their study. Accessible to graduate students with basic grounding in commutative algebra and algebraic geometry, it can be used alongside general texts to illustrate the theory with a particularly interesting and important class of varieties.","[Place of publication not identified] : Springer, 2023.",,,Title from content provider.,1 online resource,,,,,010785813,"Determinants, Gröbner Bases and Cohomology is an up-to-date, comprehensive account of determinantal rings and varieties.

"Developing Public Service Leaders : Elite Orchestration, Change Agency, Leaderism, and Neoliberalization - Duke University Libraries Catalog",,"Wallace, Mike","Developing Public Service Leaders examines why and how governments and representative bodies in public service organizations have mounted major interventions over the last two decades to develop senior staff as leaders. A critical explanation is developed of the foundational contribution made by national leadership development interventions in the 2000s to the emergence, proliferation, and normalization of leadership development provision. Through carrying out qualitative research in England, the authors investigate the national leadership development interventions for school education, healthcare, and higher education. Whilst also looking at the contemporary legacy of these interventions within a global scale, examining the growing international movement and comparing interventions across the world.  The book looks at new ways to approach leadership development, adopting a novel perspective on leadership as a metaphorical concept and coining the concept of 'leaderism', and exploring how although senior staff may be widely acculturated as leaders, they may not necessarily be committed to acting as government change agents. Leadership development makes a diffuse contribution towards the ongoing neoliberalization of public services.

The diaspora of the Comoros in France : ethnicised biopolitics and communitarisation - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Fritsch, Katharina, 1956-","Based on an ethnographic study of mobilisations of the Comorian diaspora in Marseille during political and cultural events, the book examines communitarisation in relation to three thematic areas, namely spaces, cultural markets and local politics. Drawing on Foucault's concept of the dispositif, the author analyses mobilisations of postcolonial diaspora as part of a dispositif of communitarisation, that is, a set of discourses, practices, institutions and subjectivations of diasporic community. She argues that constructions of 'community' are both shaped by and shape ethnicised biopolitics, expressed by modes of governing diasporic groups along ethnicised divisions and a marking of ethnicised communities as the Other of the French Republic. The performativity of a Comorian community brought into being through political, cultural, economic and customary practices also shows how Comorian communities govern themselves along ethnicised categories, at the intersection with generation, gender, age classes, locality and class. Communitarisation processes as part of ethnicised (self-)governing reveal postcolonial power relations in France as well as practices of negotiation and contestation on the part of Comorian communities.

To what extent were these possible?· How much did the regime coerce the population and how much did it try to indoctrinate?· What was the difference for Party leaders, comrades and members in terms of the possibilities and opportunities that opened up, compared to everyone else in society?· With the shutting down - to a large extent - of civil society and state intrusion into private life, what restrictions were placed on ordinary and day-to-day activities?· What happened to religious life and to cultural life and the arts?· How were personal choices in aspects of life such as reproduction, education and even eating affected by these regimes?· What was the impact of different political ideologies on people's way of life - whether Fascist, Nazi or Communist?

Digital finance and the future of the global financial system : disruption and innovation in financial services - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Gasiorkiewicz, Lech","This book offers an in-depth analysis of the most salient features of contemporary financial systems and clarifies the major strategic issues facing the development of digital finance. It provides insight into how the digital finance system actually works in a socioeconomic context. It presents three key messages: that digital transformation will change the financial system entirely, that the State has a particularly important role to play in the whole process and that consumers will be offered more opportunities and freedom but simultaneously will be exposed to more risk and challenges. The book is divided into four parts. It begins by laying down the fundamentals of the subsequent analysis and offers a deep understanding of digital finance, including a topology of the key technologies applied in the transformation process. The next part reviews the challenges facing the digital State in the new reality, the digitalization of public finance and the development of digitally relevant taxation systems. In the third part, digital consumer aspects are discussed. The final part examines the risks and challenges of digital finance. The authors focus their attention on three key developments in financial markets: accelerated growth in terms of the importance of algorithms, replacing existing legal regulations; the expansion of cyber risk and its growing impact and finally the emergence of new dimensions of systemic risk as a side effect of financial digitalization. The authors supplement the analysis with a discussion of how these new risks and challenges are monitored and mitigated by financial supervision.

It provides an innovative and enriching take on the work experience from the pandemic times and discusses the challenges of ongoing changes in labour markets and workplaces in a way that is not covered by the extant literature.The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and digitalisation on labour market outcomes is analysed throughout 12 chapters, by 34 labour market experts from various CEE countries. Most chapters are based on empirical methods yet are presented in an easy-to-follow way to make the book also accessible for a non-scientific audience. The volume addresses the three key goals:  to better understand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the adoption of workplace digitalisation in the selected labour markets in CEE countries and the potential trade-offs facing those who do and do not have access to this benefit to complement the labour market research by incorporating the outputs of changing demand for skills to contribute new insight into policies and regulations that govern the future of work The book argues that the recent COVID-19 pandemic was a sombre reminder of the relevance and necessity of digital technology for a variety of sectors and market activities. It concludes that to downside the risks of vanishing jobs, as well as to minimise the threats and maximise the opportunities of digitalisation in CEE countries, labour market partners need to consider an effective governance tool in terms of inclusive access to the digital environment, re-skilling, and balanced regulations of the more problematic facets of digital work.The book will be of interest to postgraduate researchers and academics in the fields of labour economics, regional economics, and macroeconomics. Additionally, due to the broader policy implications of the topic, the book will appeal to policymakers and experts interested in labour economics.The Introduction, Chapters 4 and 12 of this book are freely available as a downloadable Open Access PDF at http: //www.taylorfrancis.com under a Creative Commons Attribution-Non Commercial-No Derivatives (CC-BY-NC-ND) 4.0 license.

"DINNER WITH THE PRESIDENT : FOOD, POLITICS, AND A HISTORY OF BREAKING BREAD AT THE WHITE HOUSE. - Duke University Libraries Catalog",,"Prud'homme, Alex","A wonderfully entertaining, often surprising history of presidential taste, from the grim meals eaten by Washington and his starving troops at Valley Forge to Trump's fast-food burgers and Biden's ice cream--what they ate, why they ate it, and what it tells us about the state of the nation--from the coauthor of Julia Child's best-selling memoir My Life in France   ""[A] beautifully written book about how the presidential palate has helped shape America...Fascinating.""--Stanley Tucci   Some of the most significant moments in American history have occurred over meals, as U.S. presidents broke bread with friends or foe: Thomas Jefferson's nationbuilding receptions in the new capital, Washington, D.C.; Ulysses S. Grant's state dinner for the king of Hawaii; Teddy Roosevelt's groundbreaking supper with Booker T. Washington; Richard Nixon's practiced use of chopsticks to pry open China; Jimmy Carter's cakes and pies that fueled a détente between Israel and Egypt at Camp David.  Here Alex Prud'homme invites readers into the White House kitchen to reveal the sometimes curious tastes of twenty-six of America's most influential presidents, how their meals were prepared and by whom, and the ways their choices affected food policy around the world. And the White House menu grew over time-- from simple eggs and black coffee for Abraham Lincoln during the Civil War and celebratory turtle soup after and squirrel stew for Dwight Eisenhower, to jelly beans and enchiladas for Ronald Reagan and arugula for Barack Obama. What our leaders say about food touches on everything from our nation's shifting diet and local politics to global trade, science, religion, war, class, gender, race, and so much more.  Prud'homme also details overlooked figures, like George Washington's enslaved chef, Hercules Posey, whose meals burnished the president's reputation before the cook narrowly escaped to freedom, and pioneering First Ladies, such as Dolley Madison and Jackie Kennedy, who used food and entertaining to build political and social relationships. As he weaves these stories together, Prud'homme shows that food is not just fuel when it is served to the most powerful people in the world. It is a tool of communication, a lever of power and persuasion, a form of entertainment, and a symbol of the nation.  Included are ten authentic recipes for favorite presidential dishes, such as: Martha Washington's Preserved Cherries Abraham Lincoln's Gingerbread Men William H.

Disability and labour in the twentieth century : historical and comparative perspectives - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Dinu, Radu Harald","This volume puts disability and labour at the centre of historical enquiry. It offers fresh perspectives on the history of disability and labour in the twentieth century and highlights the need to address the topic beyond regional boundaries. Bringing together historians and disability scholars from a variety of disciplines and regions, the chapters investigate various historical settings, ranging from work cooperatives to disability associations and informal workplaces, and analyse multiple meanings of labour in different political and economic systems through the lens of disability. The book's contributors demonstrate that the nexus between labour and disability in modern, industrialised societies resists easy generalisations, as marginalisation and integration were often two sides of the same coin: While the experience of many disabled people has been marked by exclusion from mainstream production, labour also became a vehicle for integration and emancipation. Addressing one of the research gaps of the disability history field, which has long been dominated by British and North American perspectives, the book sheds light on less-studied examples from Scandinavian countries and Eastern Europe including Czechoslovakia, Poland, the Soviet Union, Bulgaria and Romania. Cutting across national, cultural and class divides the volume provides a springboard for reflections on common experiences of disability and labour during the twentieth century.

"Disability, diversity and inclusive education in Haiti : learning, exclusion and educational relationships in the context of crises - Duke University Libraries Catalog",,"Lainy, Rochambeau","This book examines disability, diversity, and schooling exclusion in Haiti in the wake of Hurricane Matthew. Defending a social and anthropological conception of disability as a consequence of any situation that makes a subject uncomfortable and unable to live or act properly, the book explores the difficulties that disabled children face within the school system and considers how social exclusion provokes and exacerbates educational exclusion. With contributions from linguists, educational sociologists, educational psychologists, educators, and historians, the chapters focus on a range of phenomena such as the balance of languages used for teaching, gender equity, associated disorders, and the experiences of left-handed and deaf students. Ultimately, the authors demonstrate how the educational relationships built and practiced in school influence the perceptions of people with disabilities, with respect to both singular contexts and pedagogical practices. As such, it represents an important study of the relationship between school exclusion, disability, and those with precarious socio-familial conditions, and how they can be conceptualized and addressed in the context of crises.

Disabled Child : Memoirs of a Normal Future - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Apgar, Amanda","When children are born with disabilities or become disabled in childhood, parents often experience bewilderment: they find themselves unexpectedly in another world, without a roadmap, without community, and without narratives to make sense of their experiences. The Disabled Child: Memoirs of a Normal Future tracks the narratives that have emerged from the community of parent-memoirists who, since the 1980s, have written in resistance of their children's exclusion from culture. Though the disabilities represented in the genre are diverse, the memoirs share a number of remarkable similarities; they are generally written by white, heterosexual, middle or upper-middle class, ablebodied parents, and they depict narratives in which the disabled child overcomes barriers to a normal childhood and adulthood. Apgar demonstrates that in the process of telling these stories, which recuperate their children as productive members of society, parental memoirists write their children into dominant cultural narratives about gender, race, and class.

Disagreement Behavior Analysis of Signed Networks - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Meng, Deyuan","This book investigates the disagreement behavior analysis problems for signed networks in the presence of both cooperative and antagonistic interactions among agents. Owing to the existing antagonistic interactions, signed networks exhibit a variety of disagreement behaviors subject to different topology conditions, especially in comparison with commonly considered unsigned networks involving only cooperative interactions among agents. Since signed networks are generally adopted to describe the dynamics of some practical network systems, they have attracted much attention in many areas, such as biology, sociology, economics, and politics. By focusing on agents with the first-order linear dynamics, the book establishes the systematic behavior analysis frameworks for signed networks, under which diverse disagreement behaviors have been disclosed, including both convergence and fluctuation behaviors, regardless of static or dynamic network topologies. In particular, a class of dynamic signed networks has been introduced, together with the associated dynamic distributed controller design and disagreement behavior analysis of agents. This book is intended for undergraduate and graduate students, engineers, and researchers who are interested in control of network systems, multi-agent systems, social networks, and so on.","[Place of publication not identified] : Springer, 2023.",,,Title from content provider.,1 online resource,,,,,010785819,"This book investigates the disagreement behavior analysis problems for signed networks in the presence of both cooperative and antagonistic interactions among agents.

Disappearing rooms : the hidden theaters of immigration law - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Castañeda, Michelle, 1987-","""In Disappearing Rooms Michelle Castañeda lays bare the criminalization of race enacted every day in U.S. immigration courts and detention centers.

"Discourses, modes, media and meaning in an era of pandemic : a multimodal discourse analysis approach - Duke University Libraries Catalog",,"Tan, Sabine","The COVID-19 pandemic has affected all aspects of our everyday lives - from the political to the economic to the social. Using a multimodal discourse analysis approach, this dynamic collection examines various discourses, modes and media in circulation during the early stages of the pandemic, and how these have impacted our daily lives in terms of the various meanings they express. Examples include how national and international news organisations communicate important information about the virus and the crisis, the public's reactions to such communications, the resultant (counter-)discourses as manifested in social media posts and memes, as well as the impact social distancing policies and mobility restrictions have had on people's communication and interaction practices. The book offers a synoptic view of how the pandemic was communicated, represented and (re-)contextualised across different spheres, and ultimately hopes to help account for the significant changes we are continuing to witness in our everyday lives as the pandemic unfolds.This volume will appeal primarily to scholars in the field of (multimodal) discourse analysis. It will also be of interest to researchers and graduate students in other fields whose work focuses on the use of multimodal artefacts for communication and meaning making.The Open Access version of this book, available at http: //www.taylorfrancis.com, has been made available under a Creative Commons Attribution-Non Commercial-No Derivatives 4.0 license.

Dismantling disproportionality : a culturally responsive and sustaining systems approach - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Hernández, María G.","This book positions disproportionality as not solely a special education issue but, rather, a broader issue of educational inequality. Disproportionality in special education parallels a persistent history of chronic socioeconomic and racial inequalities relating to the country's history of denying educational opportunities to students of color, multilingual students, students with disabilities, and those at the intersections of these identities. This book draws on the authors' experiences as technical assistance providers with the Center for Disproportionality, coupled with the latest research findings on the causes of racial disproportionality in general and special education. Dismantling Disproportionality examines four district case studies, showing how each progresses from theory to practice in delivering educational services to all students. The authors conclude that the most effective way to address disproportionality is to use a culturally responsive educational systems approach that critically engages practitioners at the intersection of beliefs, policies, procedures, and practices.

Distracted from meaning : a philosophy of smartphones - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Roholt, Tiger C.","When our smartphones distract us, much more is at stake than a momentary lapse of attention. Our use of smartphones can interfere with the building-blocks of meaningfulness and the actions that shape our self-identity. By analyzing social interactions and evolving experiences, Roholt reveals the mechanisms of smartphone-distraction that impact our meaningful projects and activities. Roholt's conception of meaning in life draws from a disparate group of philosophers -- Susan Wolf, John Dewey, Hubert Dreyfus, Martin Heidegger, and Albert Borgmann. Central to Roholt's argument are what Borgmann calls focal practices: dinners with friends, running, a college seminar, attending sporting events. As a recurring example, Roholt develops the classification of musical instruments as focal things, contending that musical performance can be fruitfully understood as a focal practice.Through this exploration of what generates meaning in life, Roholt makes us rethink the place we allow smartphones to occupy in the everyday. But he remains cautiously optimistic. This thoughtful, needed interrogation of smartphones shows how we can establish a positive role for technologies within our lives.","London ; New York : Bloomsbury Academic, 2023.©2023",English,,Includes bibliographical references and index.,1 online resource (234 pages.) :,File type: text file,,,,010786759,"Our use of smartphones can interfere with the building-blocks of meaningfulness and the actions that shape our self-identity.

Distributed Economic Operation in Smart Grid : Model-Based and Model-Free Perspectives - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Qin, Jiahu","This book aims to work out the distributed economic operation in smart grids in a systematic way, which ranges from model-based to model-free perspectives. The main contributions of this book can be summarized into three folds. First, we investigate the fundamental economic operation problems in smart grids from model-based perspective. Specifically, these problems can be modeled as deterministic optimization models, and we propose some distributed optimization algorithms by integrating the multi-agent consensus theory and optimization techniques to achieve the distributed coordination of various generation units and loads. Second, due to the randomness of the large-scale renewable energies and the flexibility of the loads, we further address these economic operation problems from a model-free perspective, and we propose learning-based approaches to address the uncertainty and randomness. At last, we extend the idea of model-based and model-free algorithms to plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) charging/discharging scheduling problem, the key challenge of which involves multiple objectives simultaneously while the behavior of PEVs and the electricity price are intrinsically random. This book presents several recent theoretical findings on distributed economic operation in smart grids from model-based and model-free perspectives. By systematically integrating novel ideas, fresh insights, and rigorous results, this book provides a base for further theoretical research on distributed economic operation in smart grids. It can be a reference for graduates and researchers to study the operation and management in smart grids.

Alexander Garton-Eisenacher resolves this tension between epistemological reliability and divine freedom, building particularly from the work of Karl Barth. Garton-Eisenacher offers a fresh reading of the Church Dogmatics that demonstrates how Barth's theology provides a promising starting point but note that his argument is ultimately undermined by the doctrine of eternity within which it is framed. The author overcomes this issue by showing how the promising motifs employed by Barth can be authentically derived from the classical doctrine of eternity instead. In so doing, this work shows that reading classical eternity against a Barthian background also serves to draw out a more temporal interpretation of the doctrine than its contemporary characterization, reclaiming it as a viable Christian understanding of God's relationship to time.","G̲ttingen : Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht, [2023]©2023",English,,"Thesis (Ph.D.)--University of Cambridge, 2021.Includes bibliographical references (pages 199-204) and index.",204 pages ; 24 cm,,,1355288956.0,International Standard Article Number: 9783525567357,010787370,"Alexander Garton-Eisenacher offers a fresh reading of the Church Dogmatics that demonstrates how Barth's theology provides a promising starting point.

Does scripture speak for itself? : the Museum of the Bible and the politics of interpretation - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Hicks-Keeton, Jill, 1983-","Is the Bible the unembellished Word of God or the product of human agency? There are different answers to that question. And they lie at the heart of this book's powerful exploration of the fraught ways in which money, race and power shape the story of Christianity in American public life. The authors' subject is the Museum of the Bible in Washington, DC: arguably the latest example of a long line of white evangelical institutions aiming to amplify and promote a religious, political, and moral agenda of their own. In their careful and compelling investigation, Jill Hicks-Keeton and Cavan Concannon disclose the ways in which the Museum's exhibits reinforce a particularized and partial interpretation of the Bible's meaning. Bringing to light the Museum's implicit messaging about scriptural provenance and audience, the authors reveal how the MOTB produces a version of the Bible that in essence authorizes a certain sort of white evangelical privilege; promotes a view of history aligned with that same evangelical aspiration; and above all protects a cohort of white evangelicals from critique. They show too how the Museum collapses vital conceptual distinctions between its own conservative vision of the Bible and 'The Bible' as a cultural icon. This revelatory volume above all confirms that scripture - for all the claims made for it that it speaks only divine truth - can in the end never be separated from human politics.","Cambridge, United Kingdom ; New York, NY : Cambridge University Press, 2023.©2023",English,,Includes bibliographical references and index.,"viii, 239 pages : illustrations ; 24 cm",,"Criticism, interpretation, etc",1269507221.0,LCCN: 2021045483,010712215,"Money, race and power shape the story of Christianity in American public life.

Doing Indefinite Time : An Ethnography of Long-Term Imprisonment in Switzerland - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Marti, Irene","This open access book provides insights into the everyday lives of long-term prisoners in Switzerland who are labelled as 'dangerous' and are preventatively held in indefinite, probably lifelong, incarceration. It explores prisoners' manifold ways of inhabiting the prison which can be used to challenge well established notions about the experience of imprisonment, such as 'adaptation', 'coping', and 'resistance'. Drawing on ethnographic data generated in two high-security prisons housing male offenders, this book explores how the various spaces of the prison affect prisoners' sense of self and experience of time, and how, in particular, the indeterminate nature of their imprisonment affects their perceptions of place and space. It sheds light on prisoners' subjective, emplaced and embodied perceptions of the prisons' various everyday time-spaces in the cell, at work, and during leisure time, and the forms of agency they express. It provides insight into prisoners' everyday habits, practices, routines, and rhythms as well as the profoundly existential issues that are engendered, (re)arranged, and anchored in these everyday contexts. It also offers insights into the penal policies, norms, and practices developed and followed by prison authorities and staff.

Domains and Major Transitions of Social Evolution - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,Boomsma,"Evolutionary change is usually incremental and continuous, but some increases in organizational complexity have been radical and divisive. Evolutionary biologists, who refer to such events as ""major transitions"", have not always appreciated that these advances were novel forms of pairwise commitment that subjugated previously independent agents. Inclusive fitness theory convincingly explains cooperation and conflict in societies of animals and free-living cells, but to deserve its eminent status it should also capture how major transitions originated: from prokaryote cells to eukaryote cells, via differentiated multicellularity, to colonies with specialized queen and worker castes. As yet, no attempt has been made to apply inclusive fitness principles to the origins of these events.  Domains and Major Transitions of Social Evolution develops the idea that major evolutionary transitions involved new levels of informational closure that moved beyond looser partnerships. Early neo-Darwinians understood this principle, but later social gradient thinking obscured the discontinuity of life's fundamental organizational transitions. The author argues that the major transitions required maximal kinship in simple ancestors - not conflict reduction in already elaborate societies. Reviewing more than a century of literature, he makes testable predictions, proposing that open societies and closed organisms require very different inclusive fitness explanations. It appears that only human ancestors lived in societies that were already complex before our major cultural transition occurred. We should therefore not impose the trajectory of our own social history on the rest of nature.  This thought-provoking text is suitable for graduate-level students taking courses in evolutionary biology, behavioural ecology, organismal developmental biology, and evolutionary genetics, as well as professional researchers in these fields. It will also appeal to a broader, interdisciplinary audience, including the social sciences and humanities.","[Place of publication not identified] : Oxford University Press, 2023.",,,Title from content provider.,1 online resource,,,,,010759166,"Evolutionary change is usually incremental and continuous, but some increases in organizational complexity have been radical and divisive.

DRIVING THE GREEN BOOK : A ROAD TRIP THROUGH THE LIVING HISTORY OF BLACK RESISTANCE. - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Hall, Alvin D.","Join award-winning broadcaster Alvin Hall on a journey through America's haunted racial past, with the legendary Green Book as your guide. For countless Americans, the open road has long been a place where dangers lurk. In the era of Jim Crow, Black travelers encountered locked doors, hostile police, and potentially violent encounters almost everywhere, in both the South and the North. From 1936 to 1967, millions relied on The Negro Motorist Green Book, the definitive guide to businesses where they could safely rest, eat, or sleep.  Most Americans only know of the guide from the 2018 Green Book movie or the 2020 Lovecraft Country TV show. Alvin Hall set out to revisit the world of the Green Book to instruct us all on the real history of the guide that saved many lives. With his friend Janée Woods Weber, he drove from New York to Detroit to New Orleans, visiting motels, restaurants, shops, and stores where Black Americans once found a friendly welcome. They explored historical and cultural landmarks, from the theatres and clubs where stars like Duke Ellington and Lena Horne performed to the Lorraine Motel where Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was assassinated. Along the way, they gathered memories from some of the last living witnesses for whom the Green Book meant survival--remarkable people who not only endured but rose above the hate, building vibrant Black communities against incredible odds. Driving the Green Book is a vital work of national history as well as a hopeful chronicle of Black resilience and resistance. The book contains 25 outstanding black and white photos and ephemera.

Drug legalization in federalist constitutional democracies : the Canadian cannabis case study in comparative context - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Alati, Daniel, 1986-","This book uses the Canadian cannabis legalization experiment, analyzed in the historical context of wider drug criminalization in Canada and placed in an international perspective, to examine important lessons about the differential implementation of federal law in jurisdictions within federalist constitutional democracies.

Drugs Easily Explained - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Seifert, Roland","Billions of people worldwide take medicines every day to treat important diseases. In many cases, however, neither the doctor nor the pharmacist has the time to explain to the patient why a particular drug should be taken, how the drug works and what side effects to expect. Of course, the patient can find ""everything"" about a particular drug on the Internet. But how reliable and understandable is this information? In addition, most Internet sources do not point out the interrelationships between different diseases and drug interactions. Written by an experienced and well-known textbook author, this book provides an overview of the most common diseases and the drugs used to treat them. The book is designed for a general audience. It provides patients with essential information about how medications work and what side effects and interactions to expect.

Matisoff and Noonan assess the scope and impact of the green building movement, which is working towards decarbonizing a sector that accounts for more than a third of global carbon emissions."
"Ecology, Systematics, and the Natural History of Predaceous Diving Beetles (Coleoptera : Dytiscidae) - Duke University Libraries Catalog",,"Yee, Donald A.","The 2nd edition of this comprehensive book provides one of the most complete overviews of the aquatic beetles in the family Dytiscidae, also known as predaceous diving beetles. Dytiscids constitute one of the largest families of freshwater insects with approximately 4,650 named species that come in a variety of sizes, colors, and habitat affinities. Although dytiscid adults and larvae are ubiquitous throughout a variety of aquatic habitats, and are important predators on other aquatic invertebrates and vertebrates, there are no compilations that have focused on summarizing the knowledge on aspects of their ecology, systematics, and biology.  Chapters in this book summarize hitherto scattered topics, including their anatomy and habitats, chemical and community ecology, phylogenies and larval morphology including chaetotaxy, sexual systems, predation, dispersal, conservation, and cultural and historical aspects. The 2nd edition offers updates on the newest scientific findings on dytiscids and also includes a new chapter on the subterranean fauna from Australia. The information in this new edition is potentially beneficial to anyone working in aquatic systems where dytiscids are an important part of the food web. Moreover, readers will gain a greater appreciation of dytiscids as model organisms for investigations of fundamental principles derived from ecological and evolutionary theory. Contributed chapters are by authors who are actively engaged in studying dytiscids, and each chapter provides color photos and future directions for research.","[Place of publication not identified] : Springer, 2023.",,,Title from content provider.,1 online resource,,,,,010854265,"Dytiscids constitute one of the largest families of freshwater insects with approximately 4,650 named species.

"Economic and political democracy in complex times : history, analysis and policy - Duke University Libraries Catalog",,"Solimano, Andrés","The concept of economic democracy is traditionally identi?ed with workplace democracy and participation at the enterprise level. This is a very important dimension, but the concept of new economic democracy also recognizes that, in a world of increasing complexity, the principles of democratic deliberation and social participation have to be applied to other areas as well. This book takes a fresh look at economic democracy from various perspectives. It provides rich historical narratives of episodes of social participation in the economy and society, more broadly, from the 19th to the 21st century. It dissects the various analytical underpinnings informing the theory of economic democracy connecting it with collective choice, social contract theory, Marxian analysis and libertarian critiques. The book identi?es new areas of application of the principles of democratic deliberation and oversight such as the adoption of austerity policies, the signing of free trade agreements, the conduct of central bank policies, international investment treaties and natural resource management. It takes a guided tour through the evolution of economic, social and cultural rights and their impact on the design and implementation of social policy and the welfare/ developmental state. The book expands the notion of economic democracy from factory level to the macro-economy and then to global economic governance. It also discusses the critical links between political democracy and economic democracy and the need for a more democratic and socially equitable economy in the 21st century.

Ecopoetics of reenchantment : liminal realism and poetic echoes of the earth - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Meillon, Bénédicte, 1977-","Ecopoetics of Reenchantment: Liminal Realism and Poetic Echoes of the Earth tackles the reenchantment process at work in a part of contemporary ecoliterature that is marked by the resurfacing of the song of the earth topos and of Gaia images. Focusing on the postmodernist braiding of various indigenous and ecofeminist ontologies, close readings of the animistic and totemic dimensions of the stories at hand lead to the theorizing of liminal realism-a mode that shares much with magical realism but that is approached through an ecopoetic lens, specifically working an interspecies kind of magic, situating readers in-between human and other-than-human worlds. This book promotes a worldview based on relationships of reciprocity and symbiosis. It restores our capacity for wonder together with our sensitive intelligence. Liminal realism adopts a stance in-between scientific, mythical, and poetic worldviews as it calls attention to the soundscapes, odorscapes, feelscapes, and landscapes of the world.

Effective Kan Fibrations in Simplicial Sets - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Berg, Benno van den","This book introduces the notion of an effective Kan fibration, a new mathematical structure which can be used to study simplicial homotopy theory. The main motivation is to make simplicial homotopy theory suitable for homotopy type theory. Effective Kan fibrations are maps of simplicial sets equipped with a structured collection of chosen lifts that satisfy certain non-trivial properties. Here it is revealed that fundamental properties of ordinary Kan fibrations can be extended to explicit constructions on effective Kan fibrations. In particular, a constructive (explicit) proof is given that effective Kan fibrations are stable under push forward, or fibred exponentials. Further, it is shown that effective Kan fibrations are local, or completely determined by their fibres above representables, and the maps which can be equipped with the structure of an effective Kan fibration are precisely the ordinary Kan fibrations. Hence implicitly, both notions still describe the same homotopy theory. These new results solve an open problem in homotopy type theory and provide the first step toward giving a constructive account of Voevodsky's model of univalent type theory in simplicial sets.","[Place of publication not identified] : Springer, 2023.",,,Title from content provider.,1 online resource,,,,,010762155,Effective Kan fibrations are maps of simplicial sets equipped with a structured collection of chosen lifts that satisfy certain non-trivial properties.

Einstein Constraints and Ricci Flow - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,Carfora,"This book contains a self-consistent treatment of a geometric averaging technique, induced by the Ricci flow, that allows comparing a given (generalized) Einstein initial data set with another distinct Einstein initial data set, both supported on a given closed n -dimensional manifold.

The interaction is of great relevance for applications in relativistic cosmology, allowing a mathematically rigorous approach to the initial data set averaging problem, at least when data sets are given on a closed space-like hypersurface.  The book does not assume an a priori knowledge of Ricci flow theory, and considerable space is left for introducing the necessary techniques. These introductory parts gently evolve to a detailed discussion of the more advanced results concerning a Fourier-mode expansion and a sophisticated heat kernel representation of the Ricci flow, both of which are of independent interest in Ricci flow theory.

The first part of the book provides useful insights on changes and reforms in the energy sector of Bangladesh, while the second part illustrates the low-carbon energy transformation in South Asia and the third part covers lessons from Sub-Saharan Africa. In all of these regions, the energy sector is undergoing major changes, driven by the four D's: Decarbonization, decentralization, digitization, and democratization. Major overhauls are taking place at all levels: The country level, where energy mixes are rapidly changing, the corporate level, where large state-owned and private companies are challenged and new actors are emerging, and the local level, where technical and regulatory change has made citizen engagement and community power an option to replace or at least complement centralized supply structures.

"Elizabeth Wiskemann : Scholar, Journalist, Secret Agent - Duke University Libraries Catalog",,Field,"This biography examines the life and career of scholar-journalist Elizabeth Wiskemann (1899-1971) from her youth and student years at Cambridge to her death by suicide. Disappointed in her hopes for an academic career, she reinvented herself as a journalist in Berlin, covering the overthrow of the Weimar Republic and the rise of Nazism for The New Statesman, Nation, and numerous other newspapers and periodicals. Expelled from Germany, she settled in Prague and funded by Chatham House wrote the most important account of the Czech-German conflict and the Sudeten crisis, still a classic, followed by a detailed analysis of Nazi political and economic destabilization of the countries of eastern Europe. Her journalistic skills served her well in the war years when she worked as a secret agent in Switzerland, gathering intelligence, running agents into Axis-controlled Europe, and working closely with Allen Dulles, the O.S.S. chief in Bern. Postwar, Wiskemann returned to freelance journalism, focusing especially on Italy and Germany, while also writing several books, including the first scholarly study of the Hitler-Mussolini relationship and the first major account of the expulsion of 12 million ethnic Germans from Eastern Europe. Although a prolific writer and highly regarded as a commentator on international affairs, she remained on the fringes of academia until 1958 when she was appointed Professor of International Relations at Edinburgh (the first woman to receive a Chair there in any discipline); she later became one of the first faculty recruited by the new Sussex University. In her later years she published several works of contemporary history, including Europe of the Dictators, 1919-45, widely used in schools and universities. Blinded in one eye by a botched surgery and increasingly anxious as her other eye deteriorated, she became terrified of going completely blind and ended her life. Aside from its intrinsic interest, Wiskemann's biography is illustrative of a whole cohort of women - graduates in the 1920s and 30s - who found ways to pursue their interests in international affairs and contemporary history. In this sense the book foregrounds the gendered experience of these pioneers whose professional lives often intersected through journalism, Chatham House, and service in the propaganda and intelligence agencies of the wartime state.","[Place of publication not identified] : Oxford University Press, 2023.",,,Title from content provider.,1 online resource,,,,,010759602,"Elizabeth Wiskemann (1899-1971) was a scholar-journalist and a secret agent during World War II.

Embracing the void : rethinking the origin of the sacred - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Boothby, Richard, 1954-","A radical reinterpretation of the origin of religion through a psychoanalytic theorization of the unknown     Renowned psychoanalytic philosopher Richard Boothby puts forward a novel theory of religion inspired by Jacques Lacan's theory of das Ding , the disquieting, inaccessible dimension of fellow human beings. This notion of an unfathomable excess, originally encountered in the figure of the mother, led Lacan to break with Freud's formulation of the Oedipus complex and underlies Lacan's distinctive conception of unconscious dynamics. Leaning on this account, Boothby shows how our sense of the sacred arises from our relation to what we do not know.    Embracing the Void lays out the range of Freud's attempts at a psychoanalytic theory of religion and then sketches the rough contours of Lacan's contrasting approach.

Encounters in video art in Latin America - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Shtromberg, Elena","With insightful essays and interviews, this volume examines how artists have experimented with the medium of video across different regions of Latin America since the 1960s.     The emergence of video art in Latin America is marked by multiple points of development, across more than a dozen artistic centers, over a period of more than twenty-five years. When it was first introduced during the 1960s, video was seen as empowering: the portability of early equipment and the possibility of instant playback allowed artists to challenge and at times subvert the mainstream media. Video art in Latin America was--and still is--closely related to the desire for social change. Themes related to gender, ethnic, and racial identity as well as the consequences of social inequality and ecological disasters have been fundamental to many artists' practices.    This compendium explores the history and current state of artistic experimentation with video throughout Latin America. Departing from the relatively small body of existing scholarship in English, much of which focuses on individual countries, this volume approaches the topic thematically, positioning video artworks from different periods and regions throughout Latin America in dialogue with each other. Organized in four broad sections--Encounters, Networks and Archives, Memory and Crisis, and Indigenous Perspectives--the book's essays and interviews encourage readers to examine the medium of video across varied chronologies and geographies.","Los Angeles, California : Getty Research Institute, Getty Publications, [2023]",English,,Includes bibliographical references and index.,"xii, 275 pages : illustrations (some color) ; 26 cm.",,,1334947085.0,LCCN: 2022019877,010792612,"This volume examines how artists have experimented with the medium of video across different regions of Latin America since the 1960s.

Endpapers - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Kelly, Jennifer Savran, 1974-","A queer book conservator finds a mysterious old love letter, setting off a search for the author who wrote it and for a meaningful life beyond the binary in early-2000s New York City.   It's 2003,and artist Dawn Levit is stuck. A bookbinder who works at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, she spends all day repairing old books but hasn't created anything of her own in years. What's more, although she doesn't have a word for it yet, Dawn is genderqueer, and with a partner who wishes she were a man and a society that wants her to be a woman, she's struggling to feel safe expressing herself. Dawn spends her free time scouting the city's street art, hoping to find the inspiration that will break her artistic block--and time is of the essence, because she's making her major gallery debut in six weeks and doesn't have anything to show yet.  One day at work, Dawn discovers something hidden under the endpapers of an old book: the torn-off cover of a lesbian pulp novel from the 1950s, with an illustration of a woman looking into a mirror and seeing a man's face. Even more intriguing is the queer love letter written on the back. Dawn becomes obsessed with tracking down the author of the letter, convinced the mysterious writer can help her find her place in the world. Her fixation only increases when her best friend, Jae, is injured in a hate crime for which Dawn feels responsible. But ultimately for Dawn, the trickiest puzzle to solve is how she truly wants to live her life.

Epidemics - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,Bjørnstad,"This book is designed to be a practical study in infectious disease dynamics. It offers an easy-to-follow implementation and analysis of mathematical epidemiology. It focuses on recent case studies in order to explore various conceptual, mathematical, and statistical issues. The dynamics of infectious diseases shows a wide diversity of pattern. Some have locally persistent chains-of-transmission, others persist spatially in consumer-resource metapopulations. Some infections are prevalent among the young, some among the old and some are age-invariant. Temporally, some diseases have little variation in prevalence, some have predictable seasonal shifts and others exhibit violent epidemics that may be regular or irregular in their timing.  Models and 'models-with-data' have proved invaluable for understanding and predicting this diversity, and thence help improve intervention and control. Using mathematical models to understand infectious disease, dynamics has a very rich history in epidemiology. The field has seen broad expansions of theories as well as a surge in real-life application of mathematics to dynamics and control of infectious disease. The chapters of Epidemics: Models and Data Using R have been organized as follows: chapters 1-10 is a mix and match of models, data and statistics pertaining to local disease dynamics; chapters 11-13 pertains to spatial and spatiotemporal dynamics; chapter 14 highlights similarities between the dynamics of infectious disease and parasitoid-host dynamics; Finally, chapters 15 and 16 overview additional statistical methodology useful in studies of infectious disease dynamics.

Equity in Health and Health Promotion in Urban Areas - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,Battisti,"The book explores approaches, methods and best practices related to health promotion in urban areas. Thanks to the increasingly tight connection among urbanism, architecture, bioethics, anthropology, sociology and medicine, we are now reaching an ""ecological"" health perspective. This new viewpoint has pushed the study of social health determinants and their unequal distribution in the population, resulting in the study of the generation of structurally-determined differences in health and healthcare. There is the need to make use of a unitary framework in order to understand the intertwining of multidimensional dynamics that define the urban context and the need to disseminate, enhance, and improve existing interventions in the field. This volume consequently results in the discussion and comparison of contents and methods to be implemented in multidisciplinary interventions related to the promotion of community-based healthcare and health in the urban setting. The book represents a useful opportunity for scientific growth and international sharing of methodologies that can help develop a common language and approach to be shared across different academic spheres. This is not only an exchange of knowledge among different fields of study, but also the creation of foundations for creating an increasingly complex network of scientific culture and operational collaborations to transfer knowledge and attract academic and public attention, influencing decision-makers and gaining advocacy accordingly.

"ERNEST, WILFRED AND SIGMUND : the bagman, the sceptic and the guru. - Duke University Libraries Catalog",,"O'Mahony, Seamus","A brilliantly witty book about the intertwined lives of psychoanalyst Ernest Jones, surgeon Wilfred Trotter and the guru of psychoanalysis, Sigmund Freud. Ernest Jones was Sigmund Freud's closest associate and most fervent disciple. Clever, self-confident and intensely ambitious, Jones promoted psychoanalysis as a kind of secular religion. It was also an escape for him from a medical career blighted by repeated allegations of sexual abuse. Meanwhile, his intimate friend and brotherin-law Wilfred Trotter - a celebrated surgeon who dramatically saved the life of George V, and who took on Freud as a patient during his London exile - refused to yield to the seductions of the new Freudianism. A quintessentially English figure, Trotter was unimpressed by slick medical careerists, distrusted grand theories and lacked pomposity and self-regard.From the early beginnings of psychoanalysis to the illness of King George in 1928 and the final meeting of Freud and Trotter in 1939, Seamus O'Mahony tells the story of these three figures and their lives with lapidary wit and erudition. This is a book about cultish belief, healthy scepticism and the sexual obsessions of intellectual and bohemian circles in London, Cambridge and Vienna, and doctors in pursuit of wealth and fame. It brings to life a pivotal moment in modern cultural history and reflects on how and why the writings of a failed neurologist from Vienna became so influential.","[S.l.] : HEAD OF ZEUS, 2023.",English,,,,,,1330406934.0,,010852911,"Psychoanalyst Ernest Jones was Sigmund Freud's closest associate and most fervent disciple.

Errancies of desire : monstrous masculinities across the Atlantic - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Messier, Vartan P.","Social commentators, psychologists, and journalists all point to the idea that in the new millennium, traditional masculinity is in crisis. In contemporary film and literature, this predicament is often portrayed as a problem of desire-particularly, heterosexual desire. Male libido, it appears, is especially vicious when it is misguided. Yet the genesis of this problem is not consistently diagnosed. While some texts may situate it in the unbridled expression of human sexuality and its associated discourses, others contend it is the perverse result of popular constructions of sex and gender.  Addressing this conundrum, Errancies of Desire focuses on the intersections of phallocratic violence and masculine identity in contemporary works of fiction across three subcontinents: North America, Western Europe, and sub-Saharan Africa. In doing so, Messier details the ways in which male desire is predicated on mediated forms of predatory and misogynistic sexuality that cross national and cultural divides. Employing a comparative methodology, he interrogates common perceptions of national differences and masculine identities grounded in historical specificity. Errancies of Desire effectively argues that when associated symptoms of violent and sexist behavior are institutionalized and misguidedly construed as a masculine norm, all men can become monsters.","Syracuse, New York : Syracuse University Press, 2023.©2023",English,,Includes bibliographical references and index.,"vii, 187 pages ; 24 cm.",,"Criticism, interpretation, etcLiterary criticism",1348934830.0,LCCN: 2022026382,010791176,"Errancies of Desire focuses on the intersections of phallocratic violence and masculine identity in contemporary works of fiction across three subcontinents: North America, Western Europe, and sub-Saharan Africa.

Essays on Schopenhauer and Nietzsche : Values and the Will of Life - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Janaway, Christopher","This book brings together fourteen essays by Christopher Janaway on the philosophy of Schopenhauer and Nietzsche. They illuminate central philosophical issues in the work of these thinkers - the death of God, the meaning of existence, suffering, compassion, the will, Christian values, the affirmation or negation of life. Some of the essays concern Schopenhauer in his own right, focusing on his concept of will to life, an underlying drive which constitutes our inner essence, but which traps us in self-centred desire, a wrong identification of our true self with the human individual, an egoistic conception of the good, conflict with other beings, and an existence pervaded by suffering. Opposed to the will to life stands everything of real value: art, morality, and the kind of redemption from suffering recognized by mystics from several of the world's religions. Other essays discuss Nietzsche's critical responses to Schopenhauer, and his own challenging views on related topics. For Nietzsche, morality is a questionable phenomenon and egoism is wrongly maligned; suffering is an enhancement of life, and the attempt to eliminate it is impoverishing; art is full, not drained, of willing; the world religions and the whole idea of being saved from our life are symptoms of a malaise from which modern culture has somehow to recover. The book also features discussions of the reception of Schopenhauer by two contemporaries of Nietzsche, Richard Wagner and the analyst of pessimism, Olga Plümacher.","[Place of publication not identified] : Oxford University Press USA, 2023.",,,Title from content provider.,1 online resource,,,,,010759644,"Essays on Schopenhauer and Nietzsche : Values and the Will of Life - Duke University Libraries Catalog.

Essential Ordinary Differential Equations - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,Magnus,"This textbook offers an engaging account of the theory of ordinary differential equations intended for advanced undergraduate students of mathematics. Informed by the author's extensive teaching experience, the book presents a series of carefully selected topics that, taken together, cover an essential body of knowledge in the field. Each topic is treated rigorously and in depth.  The book begins with a thorough treatment of linear differential equations, including general boundary conditions and Green's functions. The next chapters cover separable equations and other problems solvable by quadratures, series solutions of linear equations and matrix exponentials, culminating in Sturm-Liouville theory, an indispensable tool for partial differential equations and mathematical physics. The theoretical underpinnings of the material, namely, the existence and uniqueness of solutions and dependence on initial values, are treated at length. A noteworthy feature of this book is the inclusion of project sections, which go beyond the main text by introducing important further topics, guiding the student by alternating exercises and explanations. Designed to serve as the basis for a course for upper undergraduate students, the prerequisites for this book are a rigorous grounding in analysis (real and complex), multivariate calculus and linear algebra. Some familiarity with metric spaces is also helpful. The numerous exercises of the text provide ample opportunities for practice, and the aforementioned projects can be used for guided study.

Eternity in the ether : a Mormon media history - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Feller, Gavin","Mass media and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints evolved alongside each other, and communications technology became a fundamental part of the Church's institutions and communities. Gavin Feller investigates the impact of radio, television, and the internet on Mormonism and what it tells us about new media's integration into American life. The Church wrestled with the promise of new media to help implement its vision of Zion. But it also had to contend with threat that media posed to the family and other important facets of the Latter-day Saint faith. Inevitably, media technologies forced the leadership and lay alike to reconsider organizational values and ethical commitments. As Feller shows, the conflicts they faced illuminate the fundamental forces of control and compromise that enmesh an emerging medium in American social and cultural life. Intriguing and original, Eternity in the Ether blends communications history with a religious perspective to examine the crossroads where mass media met Mormonism in the twentieth century.

The European Convention of Human Rights regime : reform of immigration and minority policies from afar - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Anagnostou, Dia","Prompted by an unprecedented rise of litigation since the 1990s, this book examines how the European Convention of Human Rights (ECHR) system and the Strasbourg Court interact with states and non-governmental actors to influence domestic change. Focusing on European Court of Human Rights litigation and state implementation of judgments related to minority discrimination and asylum/migration, it argues that a fundamental transformation of the Convention system has been under way. Repeat and strategic litigation, shifting methods of supervision and state implementation to remedy systemic violations, and above all the growing engagement of civil society and non-governmental actors, have prompted a distinctive trend of human rights experimentalism. The emergence of experimentalism has profound implications for the legitimacy, effectiveness and further reform of the ECHR system. This study provides an original constitutive account of regional human rights regimes and how they are activated by societal actors to claim rights, advance case law, and pressure for domestic legal and policy change. It will be of interest to international law and international relations scholars, political scientists, specialists on the ECHR, the Strasbourg Court, as well as to scholars interested in the human rights of immigrants and minorities.","Abingdon, Oxon ; New York, NY : Routledge, 2023.",English,,Description based on print version record.Includes bibliographical references and index.,"1 online resource (x, 239 pages)",File type: text file,,,LCCN: 2022016291,010731029,"This book examines how the European Convention of Human Rights (ECHR) system and the Strasbourg Court interact with states and non-governmental actors to influence domestic change.

European Language Grid : A Language Technology Platform for Multilingual Europe - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Rehm, Georg","This open access book provides an in-depth description of the EU project European Language Grid (ELG). Its motivation lies in the fact that Europe is a multilingual society with 24 official European Union Member State languages and dozens of additional languages including regional and minority languages. The only meaningful way to enable multilingualism and to benefit from this rich linguistic heritage is through Language Technologies (LT) including Natural Language Processing (NLP), Natural Language Understanding (NLU), Speech Technologies and language-centric Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications. The European Language Grid provides a single umbrella platform for the European LT community, including research and industry, effectively functioning as a virtual home, marketplace, showroom, and deployment centre for all services, tools, resources, products and organisations active in the field. Today the ELG cloud platform already offers access to more than 13,000 language processing tools and language resources. It enables all stakeholders to deposit, upload and deploy their technologies and datasets. The platform also supports the long-term objective of establishing digital language equality in Europe by 2030 - to create a situation in which all European languages enjoy equal technological support. This is the very first book dedicated to Language Technology and NLP platforms. Cloud technology has only recently matured enough to make the development of a platform like ELG feasible on a larger scale. The book comprehensively describes the results of the ELG project. Following an introduction, the content is divided into four main parts: (I) ELG Cloud Platform; (II) ELG Inventory of Technologies and Resources; (III) ELG Community and Initiative; and (IV) ELG Open Calls and Pilot Projects.","Cham : Springer International Publishing : Imprint: Springer, 2023.",English,,,"1 online resource (XXX, 360 p. 84 illus., 81 illus. in color.) online resource.",File type: text fileFile format: PDF,,,DOI: 10.1007/978-3-031-17258-8,010731030,"The European Language Grid provides a single umbrella platform for the European LT community, including research and industry, effectively functioning as a virtual home, marketplace, showroom, and deployment centre for all services, tools, resources, products and organisations active in the field.

Das Evangelium in einem rhetorischen Brief : ein Kommentar zum 1. Thessalonicherbrief - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Mell, Ulrich","Der Apostel Paulus leitet mit dem von ihm verfassten 1. Thessalonicherbrief einen historischen Paradigmenwechsel ein, indem er das im fruhen Christentum bislang mundlich verkundigte Evangelium von Jesus Christus in einer Schrift entfaltet. Es beginnt ca. 50 n.Chr. die mediale Revolution des Christentums, die sukzessive zu der Sammlung von 27 Schriften im Neuen Testament fuhren wird.Brieftechnische Merkmale am Beginn und Ende zeigen, dass ein halbamtliches Schreiben der Gemeindegrunder an die christliche Bekenntnisgemeinde in Thessaloniki vorliegt. Da Paulus vorschreibt, dass sein Brief in einer Gemeindevollversammlung vorgelesen werden soll, liegt in seiner Mitte eine mit rhetorischen Mitteln gestaltete Kunstrede vor, die aus Narratio, Propositio, Argumentatio und Peroratio besteht. Das rhetorische Genre ist eine beratende Lobrede, die die auf die Wiederkunft Christi sehnsuchtig wartende Naherwartungsgemeinde in den von ihr praktizierten Tugenden von Glauben, Liebe und Hoffnung fordern will. Ziel ist eine vollkommene Heiligkeit, um dem aus dem Himmel herabsteigenden Parusie-Christus einen standesgemassen Empfang zu bereiten.Besonderen Fokus legt Ulrich Mell auf die im Abschnitt Beweisfuhrung (argumentatio) gemachten ethischen Anweisungen zur Ehe, zu Geschaftsbeziehungen, zur Geschwisterliebe und Haushaltsfuhrung. Die Frage der Hoffnung, wie verstorbene Gemeindeglieder an dem irdischen Zukunftsheil teilnehmen konnen, lost Paulus, indem er aus dem Glauben an die Auferstehung Christi die Auferstehung eben in diesem Glauben Verstorbener folgert.

Every picture hides a story : the secret ways artists make their work more seductive - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Cane, William","Each year 11 million people trek to the Louvre to gawk at the Mona Lisa. Many visitors clutch guide books in hand describing the painting. For some, it's the experience of a lifetime, one they'll talk about with friends and family for decades. Yet some modern researchers say that the vast majority of people will never recognize the hidden messages in this painting. That's because those hidden messages are subliminal. Buried below the threshold of conscious awareness, Da Vinci used techniques people never notice. Not only don't people know what they're seeing, they would be shocked to find out. A surprisingly large number of famous paintings fall into the same category. That is, they employ subliminal techniques to enhance the effectiveness of the work or to encode messages within portraits and landscapes. No book, however, has ever attempted to provide an overview of the technical sophistication and arcane methods that artists worldwide have used to conceal secret meaning in their work. Every Picture Hides a Story is the first book to expose the subliminal content in the world's greatest paintings. Titillating, subversive, and building on the groundbreaking work of pioneers of art criticism, this book will enable readers to view art masterpieces with greater understanding.

Everywhen : Australia and the language of deep history - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"McGrath, Ann, 1956-","Everywhen is a groundbreaking collection about diverse ways of conceiving, knowing, and narrating time and deep history. Looking beyond the linear documentary past of Western or academic history, this collection asks how knowledge systems of Australia's Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders can broaden our understandings of the past and of historical practice. Indigenous embodied practices for knowing, narrating, and reenacting the past in the present blur the distinctions of linear time, making all history now . Ultimately, questions of time and language are questions of Indigenous sovereignty. The Australian case is especially pertinent because Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are among the few Native peoples without a treaty with their colonizers. Appreciating First Nations' time concepts embedded in languages and practices, as Everywhen does, is a route to recognizing diverse forms of Indigenous sovereignties.    Everywhen makes three major contributions. The first is a concentration on language, both as a means of knowing and transmitting the past across generations and as a vital, albeit long-overlooked source material for historical investigation, to reveal how many Native people maintained and continue to maintain ancient traditions and identities through language. Everywhen also considers Indigenous practices of history, or knowing the past, that stretch back more than sixty thousand years; these Indigenous epistemologies might indeed challenge those of the academy. Finally, the volume explores ways of conceiving time across disciplinary boundaries and across cultures, revealing how the experience of time itself is mediated by embodied practices and disciplinary norms.    Everywhen brings Indigenous knowledges to bear on the study and meaning of the past and of history itself. It seeks to draw attention to every when, arguing that Native time concepts and practices are vital to understanding Native histories and, further, that they may offer a new framework for history as practiced in the Western academy.","Lincoln : University of Nebraska Press ; American Philosophical Society, [2023]",English,,Includes bibliographical references and index.,"1 online resource (1 volume) : illustrations, maps.",File type: text file,,,,010743784,"Everywhen is a groundbreaking collection about diverse ways of conceiving, knowing, and narrating time and deep history.

Evil : A Very Short Introduction - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,Russell,"Very Short Introductions: Brilliant, Sharp, Inspiring   We regularly encounter appalling wrongdoing, with the media offering a depressing parade of violent assault, rape, and murder. Yet sometimes even the cynical and world-weary amongst us are taken aback. Sometimes we confront a crime so terrible, so horrendous, so deeply wrong, that we reach for the word 'evil'. The 9/11 terrorist attacks were not merely wrong, but evil. A serial killer who tortures his victims is not merely a bad person. He is evil. And as the Holocaust showed us, we must remain vigilant against the threat of evil. But what exactly is evil? If we use the word 'evil', are we buying into a naive Manichean worldview, in which two cosmic forces of good and evil are pitted against one another? Are we guilty of demonizing our enemies? How does 'evil' go beyond what is merely bad or wrong?  This Very Short Introduction explores the answers that philosophers have offered to these questions. Luke Russell discusses why some philosophers think that evil is a myth or a fantasy, while others think that evil is real, and is a concept which plays an important role in contemporary secular morality. Along the way he asks whether evil is always horrific and incomprehensible, or if it can be banal. Considering if there is a special psychological hallmark that sets the evildoers apart from the rest of us, Russell also engages with ongoing discussions over psychopathy and empathy, analysing the psychology behind evildoing.  ABOUT THE SERIES: The Very Short Introductions series from Oxford University Press contains hundreds of titles in almost every subject area. These pocket-sized books are the perfect way to get ahead in a new subject quickly.

The evolution of law against payment frauds - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Chen, Christopher Chao-Hung","""This book examines the evolution of legal institutions in containing and tackling fraudulent activities plaguing payment systems ('payment fraud', e.g. forged cheques, wrongful payment instructions, etc.) in Asia, focusing on laws in Greater China and Singapore. In the past century, the payment system has invited much innovation, changing the modes of payments from exchanging cash and coins to the use of cards, wire transfers and other new types of payment instruments or services (e.g. bitcoins or QR code payments). As the nature of payment services is to move money from one place to another, it naturally attracts fraudsters. Even with advanced computer technology, payment fraud is still rampant in the market, causing billions of dollars in losses globally per annum. Through an examination of payment instruments and associated frauds over time, the book illustrates a shifting trend of legal solutions from criminal sanctions and civil compensation to a gradual focus on regulations of payment intermediaries. This trend reflects the complexity of payment systems and the challenge of protecting them. The book also identifies the underlying actors and institutional characteristics driving the evolution of legal institutions to deal with payment fraud and illustrate how the arrival of new technology may affect the market and thus the evolution of legal institutions.

The evolving protection of prisoners' rights in Europe - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Cliquennois, Gaëtan","The Evolving Protection of Prisoners' Rights in Europe explores the development of the framing of penal and prison policies by the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR), clarifying the European expectations of national authorities, and describing the various models existing in Europe, with a view to analysing their mechanisms and highlighting those that seem the most suitable. A new frame of penal and prison policies in Europe has been progressively established by the ECHR and the Council of Europe (CoE) to protect the rights of detainees in Europe. European countries have reacted very diversely to these policies. This book has several key benefits for readers: - A global and detailed overview of the ECHR jurisprudence on penal and prison policies through an analysis of its development over time. - An analysis of the interactions between the Strasbourg Court and the CoE bodies (Committee of Ministers, Committee for the Prevention of Torture ...) and their reinforced framing of domestic penal and prison policies. - A detailed examination of the impacts of the European case law on penal and prison policies within ten nation states in Europe (including Romania which is currently very underresearched). - A robust engagement with the diverse national reactions to this European case law as a policy strategy. This book will be of great interest to scholars and students of Law, Criminal Justice, Criminology and Sociology. It will also appeal to civil servants (judges, lawyers, etc.), professionals and policymakers working for the CoE, the European Union, and the United Nations; Ministries of Justice; prison departments; and human rights institutions, as well as activists working for INGOs and NGOs.

"Experience and empiricism : Hegel, Hume, and the early Deleuze - Duke University Libraries Catalog",,"Ford, Russell (Russell Clarke)","A clarifying examination of Gilles Deleuze's first book shows how he would later transform the problem of immanence into the problem of difference     Despite the wide reception Gilles Deleuze has received across the humanities, research on his early work has remained scant.

Russell Ford argues that this work is poorly understood when read simply as a stand-alone study on Hume. Its significance only becomes apparent within the context of a larger problematic that dominated, and continues to inform, modern European philosophy: the conceptual constitution of a purely immanent account of existence. While the importance of this debate is recognized in contemporary scholarship, its genealogy--including Deleuze's place within it--has been underappreciated. This book shows how Deleuze directly engages in an ongoing debate between his teachers Jean Wahl and Jean Hyppolite over experience and empiricism, an intervention that restages the famous encounter between rationalism and empiricism that yielded Kant's critical philosophy.

Exposing the roots of constructivism : nominalism and the ontology of knowledge - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Smith, R. Scott, 1957-","Constructivism dominates over other theories of knowledge in much of western academia, especially the humanities and social sciences. In Exposing the Roots of Constructivism: Nominalism and the Ontology of Knowledge, R. Scott Smith argues that constructivism is linked to the embrace of nominalism, the theory that everything is particular and located in space and time. Indeed, nominalism is sufficient for a view to be constructivist. However, the natural sciences still enjoy great prestige from the ""fact-value split."" They are often perceived as giving us knowledge of the facts of reality, and not merely our constructs. In contrast, ethics and religion, which also have been greatly influenced by nominalism, usually are perceived as giving us just our constructs and opinions. Yet, even the natural sciences have embraced nominalism, and Smith shows that this will undermine knowledge in those disciplines as well. Indeed, the author demonstrates that, at best, nominalism leaves us with only interpretations, but at worst, it undermines all knowledge whatsoever. However, there are many clear examples of knowledge we do have in the many different disciplines, and therefore those must be due to a different ontology of properties.

Expository Moments for Pseudo Distributions - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Ogasawara, Haruhiko","This book provides expository derivations for moments of a family of pseudo distributions, which is an extended family of distributions including the pseudo normal (PN) distributions recently proposed by the author. The PN includes the skew normal (SN) derived by A. Azzalini and the closed skew normal (CSN) obtained by A. Domínguez-Molina, G. González-Farías, and A. K. Gupta as special cases. It is known that the CSN includes the SN and other various distributions as special cases, which shows that the PN has a wider variety of distributions. The SN and CSN have symmetric and skewed asymmetric distributions. However, symmetric distributions are restricted to normal ones. On the other hand, symmetric distributions in the PN can be non-normal as well as normal. In this book, for the non-normal symmetric distributions, the term ""kurtic normal (KN)"" is used, where the coined word ""kurtic"" indicates ""mesokurtic, leptokurtic, or platykurtic"" used in statistics. The variety of the PN was made possible using stripe (tigerish) and sectional truncation in univariate and multivariate distributions, respectively. The proofs of the moments and associated results are not omitted and are often given in more than one method with their didactic explanations.","[Place of publication not identified] : Springer, 2023.",,,Title from content provider.,1 online resource,,,,,010785919,"This book provides expository derivations for moments of a family of pseudo distributions.

The expressive instinct : how imagination and creative works help us survive and thrive - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Kaimal, Girija","Self-expression is a fundamental human drive. The need for self-expression can occur through many means both creative and mundane. The Expressive Instinct explains how the complexity of human experiences and the need to express them manifests more profoundly when distilled into artforms and dispels the idea that creativity is the domain of a select gifted few. The book explores the questions: What is the purpose of art in our lives? Could the desire for beauty, to be surrounded by elements of nature, be an innate need? Are art and creative expression essential for a good life? In this book, Dr. Kaimal links over 10 years of research, theories of evolutionary biology, brain sciences, as well as her own lifelong journey as an artist, scholar and educator in many personal and professional roles (textile designer, art therapist, researcher and educator).  This book makes the case for why we as human beings need to stay creative and not lose our abilities to channel our inner lives in adaptive expressive ways. The arts, the book argues, are a container for the range of human experiences.

"F. Scott Fitzgerald's ""The beautiful and damned"" : new critical essays - Duke University Libraries Catalog",,"Blazek, William","F. Scott Fitzgerald?s second novel, The Beautiful and Damned , has frequently been dismissed as an outlier and curiosity in his oeuvre, a transitional work from the coming-of-age plot of This Side of Paradise to the masterful critique of American aspiration in The Great Gatsby .   The Beautiful and Damned belongs to a genre that is widely misunderstood, the ?bright young things? novel in which spoiled and wealthy characters succumb to decay because of their privilege and lack of purpose. Set between 1913 and 1922, Fitzgerald?s longest novel touches on many of the decisive issues that mark the passage from the Gilded Age and the Progressive Era into the Jazz Age: conspicuous consumption, income inequality, yellow journalism, the Great War, the rise of the movie industry, automobile travel, Wall Street stock scams, immigration and xenophobia, and the fixation with youth and aging.  Published to coincide with the novel?s centennial in 2022, this collection approaches The Beautiful and Damned for its insights more than its faults. Prominent Fitzgerald scholars analyze major themes and reveal unappreciated issues with attention to history, biography, literary influence, gender studies, and narratology. While acknowledging the novel?s shortcomings, the essayists illustrate that The Beautiful and Damned has much more to say about its milieu than previously recognized.

"The failure of our fathers : family, gender, and power in Confederate Alabama - Duke University Libraries Catalog",,"Ott, Victoria E., 1971-","An in-depth study of non-elite white families in Alabama--from the state's creation through the end of the Civil War   The Failure of Our Fathers: Family, Gender, and Power in Confederate Alabama examines the evolving position of non-elite white families in Alabama during one of the most pivotal epochs in the state's history. Drawing on a wide range of personal and public documents reflecting the state's varied regions and economies, Victoria E. Ott uses gender and family as a lens to examine the yeomanry and poor whites, a constituency that she collectively defines as ""common whites,"" who identified with the Confederate cause.  Ott provides a nuanced examination of how these Alabamians fit within the antebellum era's paternalistic social order, eventually identifying with and supporting the Confederate mission to leave the Union and create an independent, slaveholding state. But as the reality of the war slowly set in and the Confederacy began to fray, the increasing dangers families faced led Alabama's common white men and women to find new avenues to power as a distinct socioeconomic class.  Ott argues that family provided the conceptual framework necessary to understand why common whites supported a war to protect slavery despite having little or no investment in the institution. Going to war meant protecting their families from outsiders who threatened to turn their worlds upside down. Despite class differences, common whites envisioned the Confederacy as a larger family and the state as paternal figures who promised to protect its loyal dependents throughout the conflict. Yet, as the war ravaged many Alabama communities, devotion to the Confederacy seemed less a priority as families faced continued separations, threats of death, and the potential for starvation. The construct of a familial structure that once created a sense of loyalty to the Confederacy now gave them cause to question its leadership. Ott shows how these domestic values rooted in highly gendered concepts ultimately redefined Alabama's social structure and increased class distinctions after the war.","Tuscaloosa : The University of Alabama Press, [2023]",English,,Includes bibliographical references and index.,1 online resource (pages cm.) :,File type: text file,,,,010744138,"The Failure of Our Fathers: Family, Gender, and Power in Confederate Alabama examines the evolving position of non-elite white families in Alabama during one of the most pivotal epochs in the state's history.

Faith in Exposure : Privacy and Secularism in the Nineteenth-Century United States - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Murison, Justine S.","Recent legal history in the United States reveals a hardening tendency to treat religious freedom and sexual and reproductive freedom as competing, even opposing, claims on public life. They are united, though, by the fact that both are rooted in our culture's understanding of privacy. Faith in Exposure shows how, over the course of the nineteenth century, privacy came to encompass such contradictions--both underpinning the right to sexual and reproductive rights but also undermining them in the name of religious freedom.  Drawing on the interdisciplinary field of secular studies, Faith in Exposure brings a postsecular orientation to the historical emergence of modern privacy. The book explains this emergence through two interlocking stories. The first examines the legal and cultural connection of religion with the private sphere, showing how privacy became a moral concept that informs how we debate the right to be shielded from state interference, as well as who will be afforded or denied this protection. This conflation of religion with privacy gave rise, the book argues, to a ""secular sensibility"" that was especially invested in authenticity and the exposure of hypocrisy in others.  The second story examines the development of this ""secular sensibility"" of privacy through nineteenth-century novels. The preoccupation of the novel form with private life, and especially its dependence on revelations of private desire and sexual secrets, made it the perfect vehicle for suggesting that exposure might be synonymous with morality itself. Each chapter places key authors into wider contexts of popular fiction and periodical press debates. From fears over religious infidelity to controversies over what constituted a modern marriage and conspiracy theories about abolitionists, these were the contests, Justine S. Murison argues, that helped privacy emerge as both a sensibility and a right in modern, secular America.","Philadelphia : University of Pennsylvania Press, [2023]",English,,,1 online resource ( 281 pages) :,Color characteristics: polychromeFile type: text file,,,,010725488,"Faith in Exposure: Privacy and Secularism in the Nineteenth-Century United States.

The fasces : a history of Ancient Rome's most dangerous political symbol - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Brennan, T. Corey","""Fascism"" is a word ubiquitous in our contemporary political discourse, but few know about its roots in the ancient past or its long, strange evolution to the present.  In ancient Rome, the fasces were a bundle of wooden rods bound with a leather cord, in which an axe was placed--in essence, a mobile kit for corporal or capital punishment. Attendants typically carried fasces before Rome's higher officials, to induce feelings of respect and fear for the relevant authority. This highly performative Roman institution had a lifespan of almost two millennia, and made a deep impression on subsequent eras, from the Byzantine period to the present.  Starting in the Renaissance, we find revivals and reinterpretations of the ancient fasces, accelerating especially after 1789, the first year of the United States' Constitution and the opening volley of the French Revolution. But it was Benito Mussolini, who, beginning in 1919, propagated the fasces on an unprecedented scale. Oddly, today the emblem has grown largely unfamiliar, which in turn has offered an opening to contemporary extremist groups.  In The Fasces, T. Corey Brennan offers the first global history of the nature, development, and competing meanings of this stark symbol, from antiquity to the twenty-first century. The word ""fascism"" has universal awareness in contemporary political discourse, which thus makes this, the first book to trace the full arc of the fasces' almost 3,000-year history, essential reading for all who wish to understand how the past informs the present.","New York, NY : Oxford University Press, [2023]",English,,Description based on print version record.Includes bibliographical references (pages 255-267) and index.,"1 online resource (xii, 291 pages) : illustrations",File type: text file,,,LCCN: 2022008598,010759690,"In ancient Rome, the fasces were a bundle of wooden rods bound with a leather cord, in which an axe was placed.

"Fascination : trance, enchantment & American modernity - Duke University Libraries Catalog",,"Kindig, Patrick","Most cultural critics theorize modernity as a state of disenchanted distraction, one linked to both the rationalizing impulses of scientific and technological innovation and the kind of dispersed, fragmented attention that characterizes the experience of mass culture. Patrick Kindig?s Fascination, however, tells a different story, showing that many fin-de-siècle Americans were in fact concerned about (and intrigued by) the modern world?s ability to attract and fix attention in quasi-supernatural ways. Rather than being distracting, modern life in their view had an almost magical capacity to capture attention and overwhelm rational thought.  Fascination argues that, in response to the dramatic scientific and cultural changes of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, many American thinkers and writers came to conceive of the modern world as fundamentally fascinating. Describing such diverse phenomena as the electric generator, the movements of actresses, and ethnographic cinema as supernaturally alluring, they used the language of fascination to process and critique both popular ideologies of historical progress and the racializing logic upon which these ideologies were built.

Fear and Primordial Trust : From Becoming an Ego to Becoming Whole - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Renz, Monika","Fear and Primordial Trust explores fear as an existential phenomenon and how it can be overcome. Illustrated by clinical examples from the author's practice as a psychotherapist and spiritual caregiver working with the severely ill and dying, the book outline theoretical insights into how primordial trust and archaic fear unconsciously shape our personality and behaviour.This book discusses in detail how in our everyday world, we lack primordial trust. Nevertheless, all of us have internalized it: as experiences of another non-dual world, of being unconditionally accepted, then sheltered and nurtured. The book outlines how from a spiritual viewpoint, we come from the non-dual world and experience a transition by becoming an ego, thereby experiencing archaic fear. This book explains fear in terms of two challenges encountered in this transition: firstly, leaving the non-world world when everything changes and we feel forlorn. Secondly, on awakening in the ego when we feel dependent and overwhelmed by otherness. The book also helps readers to understand trust as the emotional and spiritual foundation of the human soul, as well as how fear shapes us and how it can be outgrown.The book makes the case that understanding fear and primordial trust improves care and helps us to better understand dying. It will be of interest to academics, scholars and students in the fields of psychiatry, counselling, psychotherapy and palliative care and to all those interested in understanding fear, trust and the healing potential of spiritual experiences.

Fearless women : feminist patriots from Abigail Adams to Beyoncé - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Cobbs, Elizabeth","This passionate and inspiring book by the New York Times bestselling author of The Hello Girls shows us that the quest for women's rights is deeply entwined with the founding story of the United States.   When America became a nation, a woman had no legal existence beyond her husband. If he abused her, she couldn't leave without abandoning her children. Abigail Adams tried to change this, reminding her husband John to ""remember the ladies"" when he wrote the Constitution. He simply laughed--and women have been fighting for their rights ever since.  Fearless Women tells the story of women who dared to take destiny into their own hands. They were feminists and antifeminists, activists and homemakers, victims of abuse and pathbreaking professionals. Inspired by the nation's ideals and fueled by an unshakeable sense of right and wrong, they wouldn't take no for an answer. In time, they carried the country with them.  The first right they won was the right to learn. Later, impassioned teachers like Angelina Grimké and Susan B. Anthony campaigned for the right to speak in public, lobby the government, and own property. Some were passionate abolitionists. Others fought just to protect their own children.  Many of these women devoted their lives to the cause--some are famous--but most pressed their demands far from the spotlight, insisting on their right to vote, sit on a jury, control the timing of their pregnancies, enjoy equal partnerships, or earn a living. At every step, they faced fierce opposition. Elizabeth Cobbs gives voice to fearless women on both sides of the aisle, most of whom considered themselves patriots. Rich and poor, from all backgrounds and regions, they show that the women's movement has never been an exclusive club.","Cambridge, Massachusetts : The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, 2023.",English,,Includes bibliographical references and index.,1 online resource.,,Biography,,,010791569,"Fearless Women tells the story of women who dared to take destiny into their own hands.

"Feelin : creative practice, pleasure, and Black feminist thought - Duke University Libraries Catalog",,"Judd, Bettina","How creativity makes its way through feeling--and what we can know and feel through the artistic work of Black women     Feeling is not feelin. As the poet, artist, and scholar Bettina Judd argues, feelin, in African American Vernacular English, is how Black women artists approach and produce knowledge as sensation: internal and complex, entangled with pleasure, pain, anger, and joy, and manifesting artistic production itself as the meaning of the work. Through interviews, close readings, and archival research, Judd draws on the fields of affect studies and Black studies to analyze the creative processes and contributions of Black women--from poet Lucille Clifton and musician Avery*Sunshine to visual artists Betye Saar, Joyce J. Scott, and Deana Lawson.    Feelin: Creative Practice, Pleasure, and Black Feminist Thought makes a bold and vital intervention in critical theory's trend toward disembodying feeling as knowledge. Instead, Judd revitalizes current debates in Black studies about the concept of the human and about Black life by considering how discourses on emotion as they are explored by Black women artists offer alternatives to the concept of the human. Judd expands the notions of Black women's pleasure politics in Black feminist studies that include the erotic, the sexual, the painful, the joyful, the shameful, and the sensations and emotions that yet have no name.

A Female Apostle in Medieval Italy : the Life of Clare of Rimini - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Dalarun, Jacques","This book centers on a fascinating woman, Clare of Rimini (c. 1260 to c. 1324-29), whose story is preserved in a fascinating text. Composed by an anonymous Franciscan, the Life of the Blessed Clare of Rimini is the earliest known saint's life originally written in Italian, and one of the few such lives to be written while its subject was still living. It tells the story of a controversial woman, set against the background of her roiling city, her star-crossed family, and the tumultuous political and religious landscape of her age.  Twice married, twice widowed, and twice exiled, Clare established herself as a penitent living in a roofless cell in the ruins of the Roman walls of Rimini. She sought a life of solitary self-denial, but was denounced as a demonic danger by local churchmen. Yet she also gained important and influential supporters, allowing her to establish a fledgling community of like-minded sisters. She traveled to Assisi, Urbino, and Venice, spoke out as a teacher and preacher, but also suffered a revolt by her spiritual daughters.  A Female Apostle in Medieval Italy presents the text of the Life in English translation for the first time, bringing modern readers into Clare's world in all its excitement and complexity. Each chapter opens a different window into medieval society, exploring topics from political power to marriage and sexuality, gender roles to religious change, pilgrimage to urban structures, sanctity to heresy. Through the expert guidance of scholars and translators Jacques Dalarun, Sean L. Field, and Valerio Cappozzo, Clare's life and context become a springboard for readers to discover what life was like in a medieval Italian city.","Philadelphia : University of Pennsylvania Press, [2023]",English,,,1 online resource ( 193 pages) :,Color characteristics: polychromeFile type: text file,BiographyElectronic books,,,010714565,"The Life of the Blessed Clare of Rimini is the earliest known saint's life originally written in Italian.

"Femicide, criminology and the law - Duke University Libraries Catalog",,"Dayan, Hava","This book offers an interdisciplinary perspective on femicide, using Israel as an illuminating case study, given its diverse communities and common-law-based legal system. Utilizing analytical alongside practical perspectives, the book offers a novel crimino-legal approach to femicide.

Fictional games : a philosophy of worldbuilding and imaginary play - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Gualeni, Stefano, 1978-","What roles do imaginary games have in story-telling? Why do fiction authors outline the rules of a game that the audience will never play? Combining perspectives from philosophy, literary theory and game studies, this book provides the first in-depth investigation into the significance of fictional games within fictional worlds. Drawing from contemporary cinema and literature, from The Hunger Games to the science fiction of Iain M. Banks, Stefano Gualeni and Riccardo Fassone introduce five key functions that different types of imaginary games have in worldbuilding. First, fictional games can emphasize the dominant values and ideologies of the fictional society they belong to. Second, some imaginary games function in fictional worlds as critical, utopian tools, inspiring shifts in the thinking and political orientation of the fictional characters. Third, a few fictional games are conducive to the transcendence of a particular form of being, such as the overcoming of human corporeality. Fourth, imaginary games within works of fiction can deceptively blur the boundaries between the contingency of play and the irrevocable seriousness of ""real life"", either camouflaging life as a game or disguising a game as something with more permanent consequences. And fifth, they can function as meta-reflexive tools, suggesting critical and/or satirical perspectives on how actual games are designed, played, sold, manipulated, experienced, understood and utilized as part of our culture. With illustrations in every chapter bringing the imaginary games to life, Gualeni and Fassone creatively inspire us to consider fictional games anew: not as moments of playful reprieve in a storyline, but as significant and multi-layered expressive devices.","London ; New York : Bloomsbury Academic, 2023.©2023",English,,Includes bibliographical references and index.,"xiv, 198 pages : illustrations (black and white) ; 24 cm",,"Criticism, interpretation, etc",1350638043.0,British national bibliography: GBC2K0178,010850754,"This book provides the first in-depth investigation into the significance of fictional games within fictional worlds.

In January of 2021, the Biden administration inherited the most daunting array of challenges since FDR's presidency: a lethal pandemic, a plummeting economy, an unresolved twenty-year war, and the aftermath of an attack on the Capitol that polarized the country. Waves of crises followed, including the fallout from a divisive Supreme Court, raging inflation, and Vladimir Putin's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine.  Now, in The Fight of His Life , prizewinning journalist Chris Whipple takes us inside the Oval Office as the critical decisions of Biden's presidency are being made. With remarkable access to both President Biden and his inner circle--including Chief of Staff Ron Klain, Secretary of State Antony Blinken, and CIA Director William Burns--Whipple pulls back the curtain on the internal power struggles and back-room compromises. Featuring shocking new details about how renegade Trump officials enabled the transfer of power, which key staffers really make the White House run (it's probably not who you think), why Joe Biden no longer speaks freely around his security detail, and what he really thinks of Vice President Kamala Harris, the press, and living in the White House, The Fight of His Life delivers a stunning portrait of politics on the edge.","New York : Scribner, an imprint of Simon & Schuster, Inc., 2023.",English,,Includes bibliographical references (pages 329-374) and index.,"1 online resource (xvi, 397 pages, 8 unnumbered pages of plates) : color illustrations.",,Biography,,,010791570,"New York Times bestselling author Chris Whipple takes us inside the Oval Office as the critical decisions of Biden's presidency are being made.

Film and redemption : from brokenness to wholeness - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Rankin, David","This book explores the representation of the idea or theme of redemption in contemporary, popular film. The discussion focuses primarily on the work of three directors - Clint Eastwood, Martin Scorsese and Kore-eda Hirokazu - but also considers a few films from other directorial hands.

Redemption is viewed broadly as a journey from brokenness to wholeness, from imprisonment to release, or from some form of slavery to freedom.

Financial market analysis and behaviour : the adaptive preference hypothesis - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Dinga, Emil","This book addresses the functioning of financial markets, in particular the financial market model, and modelling. More specifically, the book provides a model of adaptive preference in the financial market, rather than the model of the adaptive financial market, which is mostly based on Popper's objective propensity for the singular, i.e., unrepeatable, event. As a result, the concept of preference, following Simon's theory of satisficing, is developed in a logical way with the goal of supplying a foundation for a robust theory of adaptive preference in financial market behavior. The book offers new insights into financial market logic, and psychology: 1) advocating for the priority of behavior over information - in opposition to traditional financial market theories; 2) constructing the processes of (co)evolution adaptive preference-financial market using the concept of fetal reaction norms - between financial market and adaptive preference; 3) presenting a new typology of information in the financial market, aimed at proving point (1) above, as well as edifying an explicative mechanism of the evolutionary nature and behavior of the (real) financial market; 4) presenting sufficient, and necessary, principles or assumptions for developing a theory of adaptive preference in the financial market; and 5) proposing a new interpretation of the pair genotype-phenotype in the financial market model.

The fiscal theory of the price level - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Cochrane, John H. (John Howland), 1957-","A comprehensive account of how government deficits and debt drive inflation   Where do inflation and deflation ultimately come from? The fiscal theory of the price level offers a simple answer: Prices adjust so that the real value of government debt equals the present value of taxes less spending. Inflation breaks out when people don't expect the government to fully repay its debts. The fiscal theory is well suited to today's economy: Financial innovation undermines money demand, and central banks don't control the money supply or aggressively change interest rates, invalidating classic theories, while large debts and deficits threaten inflation and constrain monetary policy. This book presents a comprehensive account of this important theory from one of its leading developers and advocates.  John Cochrane aims to make fiscal theory useful as a conceptual framework and modeling tool, and for analyzing history and policy. He merges fiscal theory with standard models in which central banks set interest rates, giving a novel account of monetary policy. He generalizes the theory to explain data and make realistic predictions. For example, inflation decreases in recessions despite deficits because discount rates fall, raising the value of debt; specifying that governments promise to partially repay debt avoids classic puzzles and allows the theory to apply at all times, not just during periods of high inflation. Cochrane offers an extensive rethinking of monetary doctrines and institutions through the eyes of fiscal theory, and analyzes the era of zero interest rates and post-pandemic inflation.  Filled with research by Cochrane and others, The Fiscal Theory of the Price Level offers important new insights about fiscal and monetary policy.","Princeton : Princeton University Press, [2023]",English,,Includes bibliographical references and index.,"1 online resource ( xxvi, 558 pages) : illustrations.",Color characteristics: polychromeFile type: text file,,,LCCN: 2022006786,010783170,"The fiscal theory of the price level offers a simple answer: Prices adjust so that the real value of government debt equals the present value of taxes less spending.

Fit Nation : The Gains and Pains of America's Exercise Obsession. - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Petrzela, Natalia Mehlman","How is it that Americans are more obsessed with exercise than ever, and yet also unhealthier? Fit Nation explains how we got here and imagines how we might create a more inclusive, stronger future.   If a shared American creed still exists, it's a belief that exercise is integral to a life well lived. A century ago, working out was the activity of a strange subculture, but today, it's almost impossible to avoid exhortations to exercise: Walk 5K to cure cancer! Awaken your inner sex kitten at pole-dancing class! Sweat like (or even with) a celebrity in spin class! Exercise is everywhere.  Yet the United States is hardly a ""fit nation."" Only 20 percent of Americans work out consistently, over half of gym members don't even use the facilities they pay for, and fewer than 30 percent of high school students get an hour of exercise a day. So how did fitness become both inescapable and inaccessible?  Spanning more than a century of American history, Fit Nation answers these questions and more through original interviews, archival research, and a rich cultural narrative. As a leading political and intellectual historian and a certified fitness instructor, Natalia Mehlman Petrzela is uniquely qualified to confront the complex and far-reaching implications of how our contemporary exercise culture took shape. She explores the work of working out not just as consumers have experienced it, but as it was created by performers, physical educators, trainers, instructors, and many others.  For Petrzela, fitness is a social justice issue. She argues that the fight for a more equitable exercise culture will be won only by revolutionizing fitness culture at its core, making it truly inclusive for all bodies in a way it has never been. Examining venues from the stage of the World's Fair and Muscle Beach to fat farms, feminist health clinics, radical and evangelical college campuses, yoga retreats, gleaming health clubs, school gymnasiums, and many more, Fit Nation is a revealing history that shows fitness to be not just a matter of physical health but of what it means to be an American.","Chicago : University of Chicago Press, 2023.",English,,Description based upon print version of record.,1 online resource (460 p.),Color characteristics: polychromeFile type: text file,,,,010852311,"Fit Nation: The Gains and Pains of America's Exercise Obsession.

Flat aesthetics : twenty-first-century American fiction and the making of the contemporary - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Moraru, Christian","Flat Aesthetics seeks to secure a more granular and ontologically demotic handle on the contemporary in American literature. While contemporaneity can be viewed as ""our"" period, Christian Moraru approaches the contemporary as some-thing made by things themselves. The making of the contemporary is variously restaged by the body of fictional prose under scrutiny here. Thus, this corpus itself participates in the making of contemporaneity.  In dialogue with object-oriented ontology and various new materialisms, Moraru contends that the contemporary does not preexist objects or the novels featuring them; it is not their background but an outcome of things' self-presentation. As objects, beings, or existents present themselves in the present, in our ""now,"" they foster thing-configurations that together compose the form of, and essentially make, the contemporary - the present's cultural-material signature, as Moraru calls it.  To decipher this signature, Flat Aesthetics provides a cross-sectional reading of postmillennial American fiction. Discussed are solely post-2000 works by writers who have also established themselves over the past two decades or so, from Nicole Krauss, Michael Chabon, and Ben Lerner to Colson Whitehead and Emily St. John Mandel. Their output, Moraru claims, bears witness to the onset of a ""flat"" aesthetics in American letters after September 11, 2001. Organized into five parts, the books canvases objectual constellations of contemporaneity shaped by material dynamics of language, museality and display, spatiality, zombification and thing-rhetoric, and post-anthropocentric kinship.","New York, NY : Bloomsbury Academic, 2023.©2023",English,,Includes bibliographical references and index.,"xviii, 268 pages ; 24 cm",,"Criticism, interpretation, etcLiterary criticism",1313903424.0,LCCN: 2022025097,010850758,Duke University Libraries Catalog Flat Aesthetics seeks to secure a more granular and ontologically demotic handle on the contemporary in American literature.

Rising concerns about environmental sustainability have increased attention toward improved, efficient, and sustainable means of crop production. Various strategies are employed in enhancing crop production to adapt and mitigate climate change and ensure food security. The future of food production relies on improving productivity without compromising long-term productivity and environmental sustainability. Feeding the ever-increasing world population would require concerted efforts by all stakeholders to combat the impact of climate change and numerous ecological challenges facing food production. Hence, innovative technologies and methods are indispensable in mitigating the effects on food security. The book looks at the current challenges and solutions, from an African perspective, regarding food safety and health management, food security and nutrition, climate change and sustainable food production, and forest resources and food security. The target audience is scientists, graduate students, researchers, academicians, and professionals in food production for sustainable development and ecosystem management. This book will also be helpful to policymakers and specialists in framing future feasible agro-ecosystem policies.","[Place of publication not identified] : Springer International Publishing, 2023.",,,Title from content provider.,1 online resource,,,,,010854515,"Sustainable food production is a global challenge with respect to climate change and an ever-increasing world population.

"Food System Transformations : Social Movements, Local Economies, Collaborative Networks - Duke University Libraries Catalog",,"Antoni-Komar, Irene","This book examines the role of local food movements, enterprises and networks in the transformation of the currently unsustainable global food system. It explores a series of innovations designed to re-integrate sustainable modes of food production and encourage food sovereignty.It provides detailed insights into a specialised network of social actors collaborating in novel ways and creating new economic arrangements across different geographical locales. In working to devise 'local solutions to global problems', the initiatives explored in the book represent a 'second-generation' food social movement which is less preoccupied with distinctive local qualities than with building socially just food systems aimed at delivering healthy nutrition worldwide. Drawing on fieldwork undertaken in sites across Europe, the USA and Brazil, the book provides a rich collection of case studies that offer a fresh perspective on the role of grassroots action in the transition to more sustainable food production systems.Addressing a substantive gap in the literature that falls between global analyses of the contemporary food system and highly localised case studies, the book will appeal to those teaching food studies and those conducting research on civic food initiatives or on environmental social movements more generally.

"For God and Liberty : Catholicism and Revolution in the Atlantic World, 1790-1861 - Duke University Libraries Catalog",,"Voekel, Pamela","The Age of Revolution has traditionally been understood as an era of secularization, giving the transition from monarchy to independent republics through democratic movements a genealogy that assumes hostility to Catholicism. By centering the story on Spanish and Latin American actors, Pamela Voekel argues that at the heart of this nineteenth-century transformation in Spanish America was a transatlantic Catholic civil war. Voekel demonstrates Reform Catholicism's significance to the thought and action of the rebel literati who led decolonization efforts in Mexico and Central America, showing how each side of this religious divide operated from within a self-conscious intercontinental network of like-minded Catholics. For its central protagonists, the era's crisis of sovereignty provided a political stage for a religious struggle. Drawing on ecclesiastical archives, pamphlets, sermons, and tracts, For God and Liberty reveals how the violent struggles of decolonization and the period before and after Independence are more legible in light of the fault lines within the Church.","[Place of publication not identified] : Oxford University Press USA, 2023.",,,Title from content provider.,1 online resource,,,,,010759726,"For God and Liberty: Catholicism and Revolution in the Atlantic World, 1790-1861.

"For-profit philanthropy : elite power and the threat of limited liability companies, donor-advised funds, and strategic corporate giving - Duke University Libraries Catalog",,"Reiser, Dana Brakman","This book exposes a migration of business practices, players, and norms into philanthropy that strains the regulatory regime sustaining public trust in elite generosity through accountability and transparency and proposes legal reforms and private solutions to restore it.  Practices, players, and norms native to the business sector have migrated into philanthropy, shattering longstanding barriers between commerce and charity. Philanthropies organized as limited liability companies, donor-advised funds sponsored by investment company giants, and strategic corporate philanthropy programs aligning charitable giving by multinationals with their business objectives paint a startling new picture of elite giving.  In For-Profit Philanthropy, Dana Brakman Reiser and Steven A. Dean reveal that philanthropy law has long operated as strategic compromise, binding ordinary Americans and elites together in a common purpose. At its center stands the private foundation. The authors show how the foundation neatly combines donor autonomy with a regulatory framework to elevate the public's voice. This framework compels foundations to spend a small but meaningful portion of the assets their elite donors have pledged to the public each year. Prophylactic restrictions separate foundations from their funders' business and political interests. And foundations must disclose more about the sources and uses of their assets than any other business or charity. The philanthropic innovations increasingly espoused by America's most privileged individuals and powerful companies prioritize donor autonomy and privacy, casting aside the foundation and the tools it provides elites to demonstrate their good faith. By threatening to displace impactful charity with hollow virtue signaling, these actions also jeopardize the public's faith in the generosity of those at the top.  Private ordering, targeted regulation, or a new strategic bargain could strike a modern balance, preserving the benefits of the compromise between the modest and the mighty. For-Profit Philanthropy offers a detailed roadmap to show how it can be accomplished.","New York : Oxford University Press, [2023].",English,,Includes bibliographical references (pages 247-314) and index.,"[ix], 329 pages ; 24 cm.",,,1346350969.0,,010761341,"For-profit philanthropy : elite power and the threat of limited liability companies, donor-advised funds, and strategic corporate giving - Duke University Libraries Catalog.

Foreign jack tars : the British Navy and transnational seafarers during the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Caputo, Sara","The British Royal Navy of the French Wars (1793-1815) is an enduring national symbol, but we often overlook the tens of thousands of foreign seamen who contributed to its operations. Foreign Jack Tars presents the first in-depth study of their employment in the Navy during this crucial period. Based on sources from across Britain, Europe, and the US, and blending quantitative, social, cultural, economic, and legal history, it challenges the very notions of 'Britishness' and 'foreignness'. The need for manpower during wartime meant that naval recruitment regularly bypassed cultural prejudice, and even legal status. Temporarily outstripped by practical considerations, these categories thus revealed their artificiality. The Navy was not simply an employer in the British maritime market, but a nodal point of global mobility.

Foundations of institutional reality - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Marmor, Andrei","In Foundations of Institutional Reality, Andrei Marmor provides a novel account of the ontological foundations of institutional facts, and argues that there are important epistemic and methodological implications that follow from this ontology. Marmor offers a grounding-reductive account of collective attitudes that comports with methodological individualism. He argues for a functional explanation of the constitutive relations between rules and practices, challenging Searle's influential distinction between constitutive and regulative rules.  The first part of the book offers a detailed reductive account of institutional facts by way of metaphysical grounding. It shows that an ontology of institutional facts requires an ontology of social rules, and the latter depends on a reductive account of collective attitudes. The second part of the book aims to show that there are a number of important epistemic and methodological conclusions that follow from the ontology of institutional facts. First, that there are certain types of comprehensive, group-wide, errors about the socially constructed aspects of reality that are not metaphysically possible. The second methodological argument is that a metaphysical account of institutional reality does not have to provide an explanation of the relevant social practices in terms that would rationalize the practice for the participants themselves. Finally, the last chapter explains the idea of hierarchical practices, arguing that basic social power-structuring rules function to transform brute power into an elaborate normative framework, constituting authoritative institutions that are central to our institutional reality.","New York, NY : Oxford University Press, [2023]",English,,Description based on print version record.Includes bibliographical references and index.,1 online resource (pages cm),File type: text file,,,LCCN: 2022029504,010759735,"Andrei Marmor argues that there are important epistemic and methodological implications that follow from this ontology.

Framework for the Evaluation of SME and Entrepreneurship Policies and Programmes 2023 - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,Oecd,"Evaluation is the foundation of evidence-based policy. Yet there is a dearth of reliable impact evaluation in the area of SME and entrepreneurship policy. This publication issues OECD guidance on how governments can promote reliable SME and entrepreneurship policy evaluation. It emphasises practices including using control groups, setting clear policy objectives and targets and accounting for business survival and non-survival. It shows that reliable evaluation of SME and entrepreneurship policy is increasingly accessible given improvements in data and techniques in recent years and illustrates this with examples of 50 reliable evaluations across many SME and entrepreneurship policy areas and 28 OECD countries. Overall, the publication issues a call for more systematic and reliable evaluation of SME and entrepreneurship policies following the guidance offered. The publication also examines the findings of reliable evaluations internationally, including meta evaluations. The evidence is mixed but generally more robust and consistent for policies to improve access to finance than in the provision of training and advisory services.

The psychoanalytic pioneers developed their ideas in tandem even if in protest to one another. Religion is a topic worthy of engagement, not least because the symbolized terrain in the history of religion was so often deployed as a vehicle for motivating, disciplining, or editing out a member of the psychoanalytic community in publication. This book offers an interdisciplinary approach to religion and psychology, including a compelling denouement that reveals new narratives about longstanding rumours in the early history of the psychoanalytic movement.

Above all, this volume demonstrates that the first generation of psychoanalysts succeeded in writing themselves into the history of religious thought and sacralizing the origins of psychoanalysis. This book offers an interdisciplinary approach to religion and psychology, including a compelling denouement that reveals new narratives about longstanding rumours in the early history of the psychoanalytic movement. The psychoanalytic pioneers developed their ideas in tandem even if in protest to one another."

From Algorithms to Hardware Architectures : Using Digital Radios as a Design Example - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Abbas, Karim","This book uses digital radios as a challenging design example, generalized to bridge a typical gap between designers who work on algorithms and those who work to implement those algorithms on silicon. The author shows how such a complex system can be moved from high-level characterization to a form that is ready for hardware implementation. Along the way, readers learn a lot about how algorithm designers can benefit from knowing the hardware they target and how hardware designers can benefit from a familiarity with the algorithm. The book shows how a high-level description of an algorithm can be migrated to a fixed-point block diagram with a well-defined cycle accurate architecture and a fully documented controller. This can significantly reduce the length of the hardware design cycle and can improve its outcomes. Ultimately, the book presents an explicit design flow that bridges the gap between algorithm design and hardware design.

From financialisation to innovation in UK big pharma : astrazeneca and glaxosmithkline - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Tulum, Öner","The tension between innovation and financialisation is central to the business corporation. Innovation entails a 'retain-and-reinvest' allocation regime that can form a foundation for stable and equitable economic growth. Driven by shareholder-value ideology, financialisation entails a shift to 'downsize-and-distribute'. This Element investigates this tension in global pharmaceuticals, focusing on the two leading UK companies AstraZeneca and GlaxoSmithKline. In the 2000s both adopted US-style governance, including stock buybacks and stock-based executive pay. Over the past decade, however, first AstraZeneca and then GlaxoSmithKline transitioned to innovation. Critical was the cessation of buybacks to refocus capabilities on investing in an innovative drugs pipeline. Enabling this shift were UK corporate-governance institutions that mitigated US-style shareholder-value maximisation. Reinventing capitalism for the sake of stable and equitable economic growth means eliminating value destruction caused by financialisation and supporting value creation through collective and cumulative innovation.

The future is not fixed : short plays envisioning a global Green New Deal - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Bilodeau, Chantal, 1968-","For all of the political, economic, and technological obstacles that stand in the way of addressing climate change, perhaps the greatest challenge is in the realm of imagination. Can we envision a better world? What might an equitable, sustainable, decarbonized, and just society look like? What if the concept of a Green New Deal-the initiative to reduce greenhouse gas emissions while addressing interwoven social problems like economic inequality and racial injustice-could become reality? The Future Is Not Fixed presents a dazzling variety of answers to these questions in the form of fifty plays-from writers representing all inhabited continents-commissioned for Climate Change Theatre Action 2021, a global participatory theatre festival that brings communities together around climate issues. The pieces gathered here feature a wide range of styles and perspectives, from realist dramas to experimental works, encompassing the dangers that we face as well as ecstatic possibilities for a renewed social contract. With contributions suitable for both conventional and nonstandard theatrical settings, these plays can be performed in intimate readings, staged productions with extensive sets and props, and everything in between. Climate Change Theatre Action plays have been performed on street corners, at the foot of glaciers, in churches, schools, libraries, backyards, community centers, and bars. They have been enjoyed by audiences as diverse as water treatment workers in Montana; homeless youth in London; refugees in Denmark; children in New York City, Iran, and Nigeria; faith communities in Florida and Washington State; unsuspecting passersby in Brazil and New Zealand; and students in every corner of the world.

The future of economic development in the Gulf Cooperation Council states : evidence-based policy analysis - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Razzak, Weshah","The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries own 30 percent of the world's proven oil reserves and largely depend on oil for their income. Yet the GCC faces serious challenges. The global demand for oil is expected to continue declining, and the average long-run oil price could become lower than its historical average in the future. This book is a research-based, structural macroeconomic analysis, providing evidence-based and future-facing policy recommendations for GCC governments. First, it analyzes historical data to explain the macroeconomic performance and economic policies of the GCC countries from 1970 to 2019. Then it presents ten-year dynamic stochastic projections from 2020 to 2030. The book examines debt sustainability and optimal fiscal policies - i.e., government spending and taxation. It also analyses structural issues, such as savings and productivity, from an institutional perspective, taking into account education, the labor market, and pension funds, as well as other factors that have a close effect on economic performance. The book is comprehensive and thorough, it relies on extensive econometric analyses, including rigorous time series analysis. The author uses both calibration of theoretical models and estimation, facilitating projections for the next decade of key economic variables under different policy scenarios. The book also assesses what the future of the GCC economies will look like if climate change and the COVID-19 pandemic continue to adversely affect oil supply and demand and the price of oil, given their current policies and institutions. As well as scholars and researchers of economics and finance, the book will engage policymakers in central banks, treasury departments, planning councils, research institutes, and think tanks.","London ; New York : Routledge, Taylor & Francis Group, 2023.©2023",English,,Includes bibliographical references and index.,1 online resource.,File type: text file,Electronic books,,LCCN: 2022003479,010649452,"The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries own 30 percent of the world's proven oil reserves and largely depend on oil for their income.

Future-Proof Science - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,Vickers,"Is science getting at the truth? The sceptics - those who spread doubt about science - often employ a simple argument: scientists were 'sure' in the past, and then they ended up being wrong. Through a combination of historical investigation and philosophical-sociological analysis, Identifying Future-Proof Science defends science against this potentially dangerous scepticism. Indeed, we can confidently identify many scientific claims that are future-proof: they will last forever, so long as science continues. How do we identify future-proof claims? This appears to be a new question for science scholars, and not an unimportant one. Peter Vickers argues that the best way to identify future-proof science is to avoid any attempt to analyse the relevant first-order scientific evidence, instead focusing purely on second-order evidence. Specifically, a scientific claim is future-proof when the relevant scientific community is large, international, and diverse, and at least 95% of that community would describe the claim as a 'scientific fact'. In the entire history of science, no claim meeting these criteria has ever been overturned, despite enormous opportunity.","[Place of publication not identified] : Oxford University Press, 2023.",,,Title from content provider.,1 online resource,,,,,010759760,"Identifying Future-Proof Science defends science against potentially dangerous scepticism.

Gandhi and Adivasis : tribal movements in eastern India (1914-1948) - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"De, Debasree","Adivasi movements played a very important, if not determining, role in the India's freedom struggle. Gandhi's idea of mass mobilization couldn't have been successful without the active participation of all sections of the Indian society. Adivasi movements were swelled by Gandhian ideology only during the Non-Cooperation movement. Though Gandhi's interest in the tribal problems crystallized at a later stage of his life, his influence on tribal movements was revealing. His association with Thakkar Bapa and Verrier Elwin also enriched his knowledge about tribal state of affairs. Adivasis started looking at Gandhi as saviour or a saint, who could deliver them justice and peace. But, Gandhi always supported Adivasi movements in order to give a mass character to his movements. There were some particular demands of the Adivasis that were not supported by Gandhi. Their armed struggle was also against his non-violent principles. During the latter half of the twentieth century, movements like Tana Bhagat and Hari Baba were purely influenced by the Gandhian ideology, but failed to achieve their goals. Later on, the Jharkhand movement adopted the character of a non-violent struggle; here also the fruits disappeared. The present work focuses on the first three movements of the Chota Nagpur Plateau of eastern India during Gandhi's lifetime and the current movements against forceful displacement by POSCO, Vedanta and others, in order to comprehend his ideological impact on Adivasi movements of today. The book has critically analysed and evaluated Gandhi's impact on the Adivasi situation in colonial and post-colonial India.","Abingdon, Oxon ; New York, NY : Routledge, 2023.",English,,Includes bibliographical references and index.,234 pages ; 23 cm,,,1295806961.0,British national bibliography: GBC290222,010711494,"Adivasi movements played a very important, if not determining, role in India's freedom struggle.

Gaseous Detonation Physics and Its Universal Framework Theory - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,Jiang,"This book highlights the theories and research progress in gaseous detonation research, and proposes a universal framework theory that overcomes the current research limitations. Gaseous detonation is an extremely fast type of combustion that propagates at supersonic speed in premixed combustible gas. Being self-sustaining and self-organizing with the unique nature of pressure gaining, gaseous detonation and its gas dynamics has been an interdisciplinary frontier for decades. The research of detonation enjoyed its early success from the development of the CJ theory and ZND modeling, but phenomenon is far from being understood quantitatively, and the development of theories to predict the three-dimensional cellular structure remains a formidable task, being essentially a problem in high-speed compressible reacting flow. This theory proposed by the authors' research group breaks down the limitation of the one-dimensional steady flow hypothesis of the early theories, successfully correlating the propagation and initiation processes of gaseous detonation, and realizing the unified expression of the three-dimensional structure of cell detonation. The book and the proposed open framework is of high value for researchers in conventional applications such as coal mine explosions and chemical plant accidents, and state-of-the-art research fields such as supernova explosion, new aerospace propulsion engines, and detonation-driven hypersonic testing facilities. It is also a driving force for future research of detonation.","[Place of publication not identified] : Springer, 2023.",,,Title from content provider.,1 online resource,,,,,010785933,"Gaseous detonation is an extremely fast type of combustion that propagates at supersonic speed in premixed combustible gas.

The gender of capital : how families perpetuate wealth inequality - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Bessière, Céline","Two leading social scientists examine the gender wealth gap in countries with officially egalitarian property law, showing how legal professionals--wittingly and unwittingly--help rich families and men maintain their privilege.   In many countries, property law grants equal rights to men and women. Why, then, do women still accumulate less wealth than men? Combining quantitative, ethnographic, and archival research, The Gender of Capital explains how and why, in every class of society, women are economically disadvantaged with respect to their husbands, fathers, and brothers. The reasons lie with the unfair economic arrangements that play out in divorce proceedings, estate planning, and other crucial situations where law and family life intersect.  Céline Bessière and Sibylle Gollac argue that, whatever the law intends, too many outcomes are imprinted with unthought sexism. In private decisions, old habits die hard: families continue to allocate resources disproportionately to benefit boys and men. Meanwhile, the legal profession remains in thrall to assumptions that reinforce gender inequality. Bessière and Gollac marshal a range of economic data documenting these biases. They also examine scores of family histories and interview family members, lawyers, and notaries to identify the accounting tricks that tip the scales in favor of men.  Women across the class spectrum--from poor single mothers to MacKenzie Scott, ex-wife of Amazon billionaire Jeff Bezos--can face systematic economic disadvantages in divorce cases. The same is true in matters of inheritance and succession in family-owned businesses. Moreover, these disadvantages perpetuate broader social disparities beyond gender inequality. As Bessière and Gollac make clear, the appropriation of capital by men has helped to secure the rigid hierarchies of contemporary class society itself.","Cambridge, Massachusetts : Harvard University Press, 2023.",English,,"First published in French as Le genre du capital: comment la famille reproduit les inégalités, Editions La Découverte, Paris, 2020.Includes bibliographical references and index.",1 online resource (pages cm.) :,,,,,010791572,"Céline Bessière and Sibylle Gollac examine the gender wealth gap in countries with officially egalitarian property law.

These climate-altering projects, which range from cloud-whitening to carbon dioxide removal and from stratospheric aerosol injection to enhanced weathering, are all technological solutions to more complex geosocial problems.    Geoengineering represents one of the most alarming forms of deliberative discourse in the twenty-first century. Yet geoengineering could easily generate as much harm as the environmental traumas it seeks to cure. Complicating these deliberations is the scarcity of public discussion. Most deliberations transpire within policy groups, behind the closed doors of climate-oriented startups, between subject-matter experts at scientific conferences, or in the disciplinary jargon of research journals. Further, much of this conversation occurs primarily in the West.    Ehren Helmut Pflugfelder makes clear how the deliberative rhetorical strategies coming from geoengineering advocates have been largely deceptive, hegemonic, deterministic, and exploitative. In this volume, he investigates how geoengineering proponents marshal geologic actors into their arguments--and how current discourse could lead to a greater exploitation of the earth in the future.    Pflugfelder's goal is to understand the structure, content, purpose, and effect of these discourses, raise the alarm about their deliberative directions, and help us rethink our approach to the climate.

Ghosts in the Neighborhood : Why Japan Is Haunted by Its Past and Germany Is Not - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Hatch, Walter","Germany, which brutalized its neighbors in Europe for centuries, has mostly escaped the ghosts of the past, while Japan remains haunted in Asia. The most common explanation for this difference is that Germany knows better how to apologize; Japan is viewed as ""impenitent."" Walter F.

This book rigorously defends the argument that political cooperation--not discourse or economic exchange--best explains Germany's relative success and Japan's relative failure in achieving reconciliation with neighbors brutalized by each regional power in the past.

Gillespie Algorithms for Stochastic Multiagent Dynamics in Populations and Networks - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,Masuda,"Many multiagent dynamics can be modeled as a stochastic process in which the agents in the system change their state over time in interaction with each other. The Gillespie algorithms are popular algorithms that exactly simulate such stochastic multiagent dynamics when each state change is driven by a discrete event, the dynamics is defined in continuous time, and the stochastic law of event occurrence is governed by independent Poisson processes. The first main part of this volume provides a tutorial on the Gillespie algorithms focusing on simulation of social multiagent dynamics occurring in populations and networks. The authors clarify why one should use the continuous-time models and the Gillespie algorithms in many cases, instead of easier-to-understand discrete-time models. The remainder of the Element reviews recent extensions of the Gillespie algorithms aiming to add more reality to the model (i.e., non-Poissonian cases) or to speed up the simulations.

Global Arsenic Hazard - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,Niazi,"This book provides a plethora of information about global arsenic (As) contamination and the challenges for environment. Arsenic is a naturally occurring metalloid that is widely distributed in water, soil, air and biota from natural and anthropogenic sources. Arsenic has been found in drinking water in over 100 countries worldwide, which caused a major public health issue including: cardiovascular disorders, diabetes, and cancers of various organs - these are some of the general health effects of As exposure. Exposure of plants to As, even at very low concentrations, can cause many morphological, physiological, and biochemical changes. The recent research on As in the water-soil-plant-human systems indicates that As toxicity to plants varies with As speciation in plants, type of plant species and with other soil factors controlling As accumulation in plants. In recent years, the development of efficient green chemistry methods for detoxification of trace metal poisoning has become a major focus of researchers. It has been investigated in order to find an eco-friendly and recyclable technique for the removal of As contamination from the natural resources.  Understanding the significance of As hazard and roles of sustainable or eco-friendly approaches in its mitigation, we intend to bring forth a comprehensive volume ""Global Arsenic Hazard - Ecotoxicology and Remediation"" highlighting the various prospects involved in current scenario.

Global Literary Studies - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,Roig-Sanz,"While the very existence of global literary studies as an institutionalised field is not yet fully established, the global turn in various disciplines in the humanities and the social sciences has been gaining traction in recent years. This book aims to contribute to the field of global literary studies with a more inclusive and decentralising approach. Specifically, it responds to a double demand: the need for expanding openness to other ways of seeing the global literary space by including multiple literary and cultural traditions and other interdisciplinary perspectives in the discussion, and the need for conceptual models and different case studies that will help develop a global approach in four key avenues of research: global translation flows and translation policies, the post-1989 novel as a global form, global literary environments, and a global perspective on film and cinema history. Gathering contributions from international scholars with expertise in various areas of research, the volume is structured around five target concepts: space, scale, time, connectivity, and agency.

The book is published by Duke University Libraries, and is available in the Duke University libraries catalog at the University of North Carolina, NC.","This book aims to contribute to the field of global literary studies with a more inclusive and decentralising approach. Specifically, it responds to a double demand: the need for expanding openness to other ways of seeing the global literary space by including multiple literary and cultural traditions and other interdisciplinary perspectives in the discussion, and the need for conceptual models and different case studies that will help develop a global approach in four key avenues of research: global translation flows and translation policies, the post-1989 novel as a global form, global literary environments, and a global perspective on film and cinema history. We also take gender and LGBTQ+ perspectives, as well as a digital approach. Gathering contributions from international scholars with expertise in various areas of research, the volume is structured around five target concepts: space, scale, time, connectivity, and agency. Global Literary Studies - Duke University Libraries Catalog While the very existence of global literary studies as an institutionalised field is not yet fully established, the global turn in various disciplines in the humanities and the social sciences has been gaining traction in recent years."

The gospel of J. Edgar Hoover : how the FBI aided and abetted the rise of white Christian nationalism - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Martin, Lerone A.","The shocking untold story of how the FBI partnered with white evangelicals to champion a vision of America as a white Christian nation   On a Sunday morning in 1966, a group of white evangelicals dedicated a stained glass window to J. Edgar Hoover. The FBI director was not an evangelical, but his Christian admirers anointed him as their political champion, believing he would lead America back to God. The Gospel of J. Edgar Hoover reveals how Hoover and his FBI teamed up with leading white evangelicals and Catholics to bring about a white Christian America by any means necessary.  Lerone Martin draws on thousands of newly declassified FBI documents and memos to describe how, under Hoover's leadership, FBI agents attended spiritual retreats and worship services, creating an FBI religious culture that fashioned G-men into soldiers and ministers of Christian America. Martin shows how prominent figures such as Billy Graham, Fulton Sheen, and countless other ministers from across the country partnered with the FBI and laundered bureau intel in their sermons while the faithful crowned Hoover the adjudicator of true evangelical faith and allegiance. These partnerships not only solidified the political norms of modern white evangelicalism, they also contributed to the political rise of white Christian nationalism, establishing religion and race as the bedrock of the modern national security state, and setting the terms for today's domestic terrorism debates.  Taking readers from the pulpits and pews of small-town America to the Oval Office, and from the grassroots to denominational boardrooms, The Gospel of J. Edgar Hoover completely transforms how we understand the FBI, white evangelicalism, and our nation's entangled history of religion and politics.","Princeton : Princeton University Press, [2023]",English,,Includes bibliographical references and index.,"xii, 340 pages 352 pages : illustrations (black and white) ; 24 cm",,,1330196773.0,LCCN: 2022010826British national bibliography: GBC2M6772,010763513,"The Gospel of J.

"The grandparent vocation : wisdom, legacies, and spiritual growth - Duke University Libraries Catalog",,"Olson, Richard P.","Many grandparents experience a surge of joy with the birth or adoption of a grandchild. For years afterward, time together is eagerly coveted, pictures are treasured and displayed, and multiple gifts along with various kinds of support are gladly provided. Richard Olson, a retired minister, professor of theology, and grandparent many times over, presents the unconditional love of a grandparent as indicative of a vocation, a calling from God. He explores the vocation of grandparent in all of its multiple dimensions of being and doing. Informed by a biblical perspective, the book explores the author's personal journey of grandparenting and includes conversations with a diverse set of other grandparents. Olson examines biblical examples of grandparenting and suggests that the grandparent vocation has possibilities that often go unnoticed. These include care, enjoyment, and response to issues throughout a grandchild's growth. He also addresses concerns for our grandchildren's future world, and how grandparents can engage in mutual conversation about faith, morals, and values in a changing world. In addition, Olson discusses increasingly common relationship types such as grandparents serving as primary caregivers, adults becoming step-grandparents through marriage, interreligious family systems, and grandparents handling children with special needs.

Grant Writing for Medical and Healthcare Professionals - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Parija, Subhash Chandra","Conducting research requires resources to meet the research need. The resources in the research institutes/ centers are often inadequate, limiting the research outcome. Research grants help overcome those limitations and help the researchers carry out quality research without any restriction. Grant proposal writing is an essential skill to be mastered by every researcher. However, the majority of the medical schools, except the few research institutes, do not have a structured learning module for obtaining grants. On most occasions, the skill of writing grant proposals goes by self-learning. For students, it is burdening due to the tremendous time consumed to learn the craft of writing the grant proposal and the exhausting clinical and academic work.  This book is carefully prepared to keep in mind the difficulties faced by the young researchers and the students concerning choosing a funding agency, grant makers' expectations, budgeting, surveillance and site visits, rights of the researcher and the funding agency, and ethical and legal aspects of obtaining the grant. The book also covers the alternate plan for partial funding or interruption of the financing, reporting the source of funding and acknowledgment, good clinical practice guidelines, and dealing with the rejected grant proposal. The research projects are often dropped or modified extensively due to the limited resources in the existing facility. The researchers are forced to compromise the research objective due to expensive requirements. There is a shortage of awareness regarding the availability of funding and grant for the conduct of research. Even if the researchers are aware of obtaining the financing, there is a lack of training in grant proposal writing, which is essential in getting the research funding.

Gravity : from Falling Apples to Supermassive Black Holes - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,Mee,"'Includes exciting recent advances in studying gravity and its cosmic manifestations.' Lord Martin Rees, Astronomer Royal, former President of the Royal Society  A fascinating historical account of how we have reached our current understanding of gravity.  There have been sensational developments in gravitational physics in recent years. The detection of gravitational waves - ripples in the fabric of space - has opened a new window on the universe. These waves are produced by the most cataclysmic events in the universe - the collisions and mergers of black holes and neutron stars. There have also been great strides in our understanding of supermassive black holes. We now know that a black hole with a gargantuan mass lies at the heart of every galaxy, and we even have an image of one such beast. Gravity: From Falling Apples to Supermassive Black Holes provides an engaging and accessible account of how we have reached our current understanding of gravity and places these amazing discoveries in their true context.  Gravity: From Falling Apples to Supermassive Black Holes is written in a captivating historical style with stories about the researchers of the past and present that illuminate many key ideas in astronomy and physics. The historical material leads from discussions of the early cosmologies to the great breakthroughs of Tycho and Kepler. We then consider Galileo's contributions to astronomy and mechanics, and the significance of Jeremiah Horrocks's ideas to the Newtonian revolution that would follow. Newton's theories brought about a new scientific age and his description of gravity was unrivalled for over two centuries until it was superseded by Einstein's description in terms of curved spacetime. The outlandish predictions of Einstein's theory have been confirmed again and again, including black holes and gravitational waves. Finally, we move on to more speculative ideas including Hawking radiation and primordial black holes and attempts to find a quantum theory of gravity.","[Place of publication not identified] : Oxford University Press, Incorporated, 2023.",,,Title from content provider.,1 online resource,,,,,010759833,"Gravity: From Falling Apples to Supermassive Black Holes - Duke University Libraries Catalog.

"The great air race : glory, tragedy, and the dawn of American aviation - Duke University Libraries Catalog",,"Lancaster, John (Journalist)","Years before Charles Lindbergh's flight from New York to Paris electrified the nation, a group of daredevil pilots, most of them veterans of the World War I, brought aviation to the masses by competing in the sensational transcontinental air race of 1919. The contest awakened Americans to the practical possibilities of flight, yet despite its significance, it has until now been all but forgotten.    In The Great Air Race, journalist and amateur pilot John Lancaster finally reclaims this landmark event and the unheralded aviators who competed to be the fastest man in America. His thrilling chronicle opens with the race's impresario, Brigadier General Billy Mitchell, who believed the nation's future was in the skies. Mitchell's contest--critics called it a stunt--was a risky undertaking, given that the DH-4s and Fokkers the contestants flew were almost comically ill-suited for long-distance travel: engines caught fire in flight; crude flight instruments were of little help in clouds and fog; and the brakeless planes were prone to nosing over on landing.    Yet the aviators possessed an almost inhuman disregard for their own safety, braving blizzards and mechanical failure as they landed in remote cornfields or at the edges of cliffs. Among the most talented were Belvin ""The Flying Parson"" Maynard, whose dog, Trixie, shared the rear cockpit with his mechanic, and John Donaldson, a war hero who twice escaped German imprisonment. Jockeying reporters made much of their rivalries, and the crowds along the race's route exploded, with everyday Americans eager to catch their first glimpse of airplanes and the mythic ""birdmen"" who flew them.    The race was a test of endurance that many pilots didn't finish: some dropped out from sheer exhaustion, while others, betrayed by their engines or their instincts, perished. For all its tragedy, Lancaster argues, the race galvanized the nation to embrace the technology of flight. A thrilling tale of men and their machines, The Great Air Race offers a new origin point for commercial aviation in the United States, even as it greatly expands our pantheon of aviation heroes.","New York, NY : Liveright Publishing Corporation, a division of W.W.

The loot amassed from years of plunder helped Olav win the throne of Norway, and a century after his death he was proclaimed 'Eternal King' and has been a national hero there ever since.Despite his bloodthirsty beginnings, Olav converted to Christianity and, in a personal vendetta against the old Norse gods, made Norway Christian too, thereby changing irrevocably the Viking world he was born into.

"The Greeks and their histories : myth, history, and society - Duke University Libraries Catalog",,"Gehrke, Hans-Joachim","In this concise but stimulating book on history and Greek culture, Hans-Joachim Gehrke continues to refine his work on 'intentional history', which he defines as a history in the self-understanding of social groups and communities - connected to a corresponding understanding of the other - which is important, even essential, for the collective identity, social cohesion, political behaviour and the cultural orientation of such units. In a series of four chapters Gehrke illustrates how Greeks' histories were consciously employed to help shape political and social realities. In particular, he argues that poets were initially the masters of the past and that this dominance of the aesthetic in the view of the past led to an indissoluble amalgamation of myth and history and lasting tension between poetry and truth in the genre of historiography.

Grief worlds : a study of emotional experience - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Ratcliffe, Matthew, 1973-","A wide-ranging philosophical exploration of what it is to experience grief and what this tells us about human emotional life.   Experiences of grief can be bewildering, disorienting, and isolating; everything seems somehow different, in ways that are difficult to comprehend and describe. Why does the world as a whole look distant, strange, and unfamiliar? How can we know that someone is dead, while at the same time find this utterly unfathomable, impossible? Grief Worlds explores a host of philosophical questions raised by grief, showing how philosophical inquiry can enhance our understanding of grief and vice versa.  Throughout the book, Matthew Ratcliffe focuses on the phenomenology of grief- what do experiences of grief consist of, how are they structured, and what can they tell us about the nature of human experience more generally? While acknowledging the diversity of grief, Ratcliffe sets out to identify its common features. Drawing extensively on first-person accounts, he proposes that grief is a process that involves experiencing, comprehending, and navigating a pervasive disturbance of one's experiential world. Its course over time depends on ways of experiencing and relating to other people, both the living and the dead. Along with its insights into the workings of grief, the book provides us with a broader philosophical perspective for thinking about human emotional experience.","Cambridge, Massachusetts : The MIT Press, [2023]",English,,Description based on print version record.Includes bibliographical references and index.,1 online resource (pages cm),File type: text file,,,LCCN: 2022004533,010854616,"Grief Worlds is a wide-ranging philosophical exploration of what it is to experience grief and what this tells us about human emotional life.

The Grimkes : the legacy of slavery in an American family - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Greenidge, Kerri K.","Sarah and Angelina Grimke--the Grimke sisters--are revered figures in American history, famous for rejecting their privileged lives on a plantation in South Carolina to become firebrand activists in the North. Their antislavery pamphlets, among the most influential of the antebellum era, are still read today. Yet retellings of their epic story have long obscured their Black relatives. In The Grimkes , award-winning historian Kerri Greenidge presents a parallel narrative, indeed a long-overdue corrective, shifting the focus from the white abolitionist sisters to the Black Grimkes and deepening our understanding of the long struggle for racial and gender equality.  That the Grimke sisters had Black relatives in the first place was a consequence of slavery's most horrific reality. Sarah and Angelina's older brother, Henry, was notoriously violent and sadistic, and one of the women he owned, Nancy Weston, bore him three sons: Archibald, Francis, and John. While Greenidge follows the brothers' trials and exploits in the North, where Archibald and Francis became prominent members of the post-Civil War Black elite, her narrative centers on the Black women of the family, from Weston to Francis's wife, the brilliant intellectual and reformer Charlotte Forten, to Archibald's daughter, Angelina Weld Grimke, who channeled the family's past into pathbreaking modernist literature during the Harlem Renaissance.  In a grand saga that spans the eighteenth century to the twentieth and stretches from Charleston to Philadelphia, Boston, and beyond, Greenidge reclaims the Black Grimkes as complex, often conflicted individuals shadowed by their origins. Most strikingly, she indicts the white Grimke sisters for their racial paternalism. They could envision the end of slavery, but they could not imagine Black equality: when their Black nephews did not adhere to the image of the kneeling and eternally grateful slave, they were cruel and relentlessly judgmental--an emblem of the limits of progressive white racial politics.  A landmark biography of the most important multiracial American family of the nineteenth century, The Grimkes suggests that just as the Hemingses and Jeffersons personified the racial myths of the founding generation, the Grimkes embodied the legacy--both traumatic and generative--of those myths, which reverberate to this day.","New York, N.Y. : Liveright Publishing Corporation, a division of W.W.

The book can be useful for three reasons. First, it is a novel way to introduce computer architecture. The codes given can serve as labs for a processor architecture course. Second, the book content is based on the RISC-V Instruction Set Architecture, which is an open-source machine language promised to become the machine language to be taught, replacing DLX and MIPS. Third, all the designs are implemented through the High Level Synthesis, a tool which is able to translate a C program into an IP (Intellectual Property).

"Habit forming : drug addiction in America, 1776-1914 - Duke University Libraries Catalog",,"Gray, Elizabeth Kelly","Habitual drug use in the United States is at least as old as the nation itself. Habit Forming traces the history of unregulated drug use and dependency before 1914, when the Harrison Narcotic Tax Act limited sales of opiates and cocaine under US law. Many Americans used opiates and other drugs medically and became addicted. Some tried Hasheesh Candy, injected morphine, or visited opium dens, but neither use nor addiction was linked to crime, due to the dearth of restrictive laws. After the Civil War, American presses published extensively about domestic addiction. Later in the nineteenth century, many used cocaine and heroin as medicine. As addiction became a major public health issue, commentators typically sympathized with white, middle-class drug users, while criticizing such use by poor or working-class people and people of color. When habituation was associated with middle-class morphine users, few advocated for restricted drug access. By the 1910s, as use was increasingly associated with poor young men, support for regulations increased. In outlawing users' access to habit-forming drugs at the national level, a public health problem became a larger legal and social problem, one with an enduring influence on American drug laws and their enforcement.","New York : Oxford University Press, 2023.",English,,Includes bibliographical references and index.The Dr. William Reid Haas and Mrs. Ardelle B.

(Anant Kumar), 1954-","Summarizing the current state of knowledge on the links between business and climate change, this timely Handbook analyzes how businesses contribute to and are affected by climate change, looking closely at their centrality in developing and deploying solutions to address this problem. Contributions from a global collection of scholars and practitioners explore a broad range of key industries' impacts and responses to climate change, examining corporate strategy and leadership in the climate economy, functional perspectives and corporate practice, and climate finance. Chapters use diverse case studies to analyze climate-related business issues, including supply chain management, decarbonization, consumer decision-making, and climate-related financial investments. The Handbook delves deeper into how businesses perceive the issue of climate change, how they are affected by and engage with it, as well as the impact they have and what this impact costs. Forward-thinking, it concludes with reflections from the contributors on what the future holds for businesses and climate change. Covering matters relating to finance, economics, marketing, operations, strategy, leadership and communications, this interdisciplinary Handbook will prove invaluable to students and scholars in business management, sustainability and environmental studies, as well as to sustainability officers (and their staff) in corporations. Addressing, as it does, a wide range of climate-related issues from the corporate standpoint, it will also prove to be a useful resource for policymakers concerned with enabling solutions to climate change.

Born in Konigsberg to secular Jewish parents, she was a student of the two major exponents of Existenz philosophy in Germany, Karl Jaspers and Martin Heidegger. Arendt escaped Nazi Germany in 1933,traveling first to Paris and then in 1940 to the United States, where she gained citizenship in 1951. As director of the Jewish Cultural Reconstruction she oversaw the collection and presentation of over 1.5 million articles of Judaica and Hebraica that had been hidden from or looted by the Nazis.This Very Short Introduction explores the philosophical ideas and political theories belonging to one of the most important thinkers of the twentieth century. As a survivor of the Holocaust, Arendt's life informed her work exploring the meaning and construction of power, evil, totalitarianism, anddirect democracy. Through insightful readings of Arendt's best-known works, from The Origins of Totalitarianism (1951) to The Life of the Mind (1978), Dana Villa traces the importance of Arendt's ideas for today's reader. In so doing, Villa explains how Arendt gained world-wide fame with thepublication of Origins, and went on to have a distinguished career as a political theorist and public intellectual. A sometimes controversial figure, Arendt is now recognised as one of the most important political thinkers of the twentieth century and her works have become an acknowledged part ofthe Western canon of political theory and philosophy.ABOUT THE SERIES: The Very Short Introductions series from Oxford University Press contains hundreds of titles in almost every subject area.

"Harry Bridges : labor radical, labor legend - Duke University Libraries Catalog",,"Cherny, Robert W.","The iconic leader of one of America's most powerful unions, Harry Bridges put an indelible stamp on the twentieth century labor movement. Robert Cherny's monumental biography tells the life story of the figure who built the International Longshore and Warehouse Union (ILWU) into a labor powerhouse that still represents almost 30,000 workers. An Australian immigrant, Bridges worked the Pacific Coast docks. His militant unionism placed him at the center of the 1934 West Coast Waterfront Strike and spurred him to expand his organizing activities to warehouse laborers and Hawaiian sugar and pineapple workers. Cherny examines the overall effectiveness of Bridges as a union leader and the decisions and traits that made him effective. Cherny also details the price paid by Bridges as the US government repeatedly prosecuted him for his left-wing politics. Drawing on personal interviews with Bridges and years of exhaustive research, Harry Bridges places an extraordinary individual and the ILWU within the epic history of twentieth-century labor radicalism.

"Harvesting history : McCormick's reaper, heritage branding, and historical forgery - Duke University Libraries Catalog",,"Ott, Daniel P.","Harvesting History explores how the highly contentious claim of Cyrus McCormick's 1831 invention of the reaper came to be incorporated into the American historical canon as a fact. Spanning the late 1870s to the 1930s, Daniel P. Ott reveals how the McCormick family and various affiliated businesses created a usable past about their departed patriarch, Cyrus McCormick, and his role in creating modern civilization through advertising and the emerging historical profession. The mythical invention narrative was widely peddled for decades by salesmen and in catalogs, as well as in corporate public education campaigns and eventually in history books, to justify the family's elite position in American society and its monopolistic control of the harvester industry in the face of political and popular antagonism.    As a parallel story to the McCormicks' manipulation of the past, Harvesting History also provides a glimpse of the nascent discipline of history during the Progressive Era. Early historians were anxious to demonstrate their value in the new corporate economy as modern professionals and ""objective"" guardians of the past. While ethics might have prevented them from being historians for hire, their own desire for inclusion in the emerging middle class predisposed them to be receptive to the McCormicks' financial influence as well as their historical messages.","Lincoln : University of Nebraska Press, [2023]",English,,Includes bibliographical references and index.,1 online resource () : illustrations.,File type: text file,Biography,,,010743787,"Daniel P.

Hate Speech : Linguistic Perspectives - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Guillén-Nieto, Victoria","Hate speech has been extensively studied by disciplines such as social psychology, sociology, history, politics and law. Some significant areas of study have been the origins of hate speech in past and modern societies around the world; the way hate speech paves the way for harmful social movements; the socially destructive force of propaganda; and the legal responses to hate speech. On reviewing the literature, one major weakness stands out: hate speech, a crime perpetrated primarily by malicious and damaging language use, has no significant study in the field of linguistics. Historically, pragmatic theories have tended to address language as cooperative action, geared to reciprocally informative polite understanding. As a result of this idealized view of language, negative types of discourse such as harassment, defamation, hate speech, etc. have been neglected as objects of linguistic study. Since they go against social, moral and legal norms, many linguists have wrongly depicted those acts of wrong communication as unusual, anomalous or deviant when they are, in fact, usual and common in modern societies all over the world.

Helena Augusta : mother of the empire - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Hillner, Julia","In the middle of the third century, a girl was born on the north-eastern frontier of the Roman empire. Eighty years later, she died as Flavia Iulia Helena, Augusta of the Roman world and mother of the first Christian emperor Constantine, without ever having been married to an emperor herself. In Helena Augusta: Mother of the Empire, Julia Hillner traces Helena's story through her life's peaks, which generated beautiful imperial artwork, entertaining legends as well as literary outrage. But Helena Augusta also pays careful attention to the disruptions in Helena's life course and in her commemoration--disruptions that were created by her nearest male relatives.  Hillner shows that Helena's story was not just determined by the love of a son or the rise of Christianity. It was also--like that of many other late Roman women--defined by male violence and by the web of changing female relationships around her, to which Helena was sometimes marginal, sometimes central and sometimes ancillary.

Could Maryam, uninterested in men, be . . . like Lamya?  From that moment on, Lamya makes sense of her struggles and triumphs by comparing her experiences with some of the most famous stories in the Quran.

Hipsterism : A Paradigm for Modernity - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Semple, Tara","This Open-Access-book utilises Hipsterism to demonstrate modes of identity, collectivity, conceptions and a whole spectrum of activities with varying degrees of commitment in contemporary society. Analysed through the lens of Modernity, Consumerism, and the New Spirit of Capitalism, it draws on qualitative research from two subsequent field stays in Berlin and is complemented by self-reflexion within the field. Young adults and their conceptions within modernity, capitalism and consumerism constitute a fundamental building block to understanding society. Little sociological work has been done in the field of Hipsterism, although it can function as a paradigm for western, affluent societies. With tools such as conscious consumption, conversations and ethical or creative work within a politically intended lifestyle, Hipsterism emerges as an attempt to navigate between individualism and collectivity. Resulting from these circumstances are a variety of forms of action, while searching for better ways to contribute and engage at the same time. Attempts to dissolve milieus and try to construct spaces where different cultures, classes and ethnicities are welcome might fail in spatial practice, but the practices in sum still leave a trace in (consumer) culture. All these activities hint at the potential of transformative and negotiating power that Hipsterism could have. About the Author Tara Semple first observed Hipsters in New York when she spent some months at the United Nations. She maintained a keen interest in the analysis of modern capitalism and influences on young adults in her work in academia and as a journalist, currently based in Zurich.","Wiesbaden : Springer Fachmedien Wiesbaden : Imprint: Springer VS, 2023.",English,,,"1 online resource (XI, 192 p. 14 illus., 13 illus. in color.

Most notably was the increasing opposition within the officer ranks of the Army to Hitler fermented by Canaris and his deputy Generalmajor Hans Oster.The final years of the Abwehr were marked by the Abwehr's efforts to undermine the regime, which came to a bloody conclusion following the Valkyrie assassination attempt of 20 July 1944.

"Home Beyond the House : Transformation of Life, Place, and Tradition in Rural China - Duke University Libraries Catalog",,"Zhao, Wei","Based on extended fieldwork conducted between 2007 and 2019, this book aims to answer a simple question: What is the meaning of home for people living in vernacular settlements in rural China? This question is particularly potent since rural China has experienced rapid and fundamental changes in the twenty-first century under the influences of national policies such as ""Building a New Socialist Countryside"" enacted in 2006 and ""Rural Revitalization"" announced in 2018. Drawing upon ethnographic fieldwork, building surveys, archival research, and over 600 photographs taken by residents along with their life stories, this book uncovers the meanings of home from rural residents' perspectives, who belong to a social group that is underrepresented in scholarship and underserved in modern China. In other words, this study empowers rural residents by giving them voice. This book links the concepts of place, home, and tradition into an overarching argument: The meaning of home rests on the ideas of tradition, including identity, consanguinity, collectivity, social relations, land ownership, and rural lifestyle.The Introduction and Chapter 4 of this book is available for free in PDF format as Open Access from the individual product page at www.routledge.com.

Homeward bound : return migration from Ireland and India at the end of the British Empire - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Dillon, Niamh","Firsthand accounts of migrants who settled in Britain offer new insights into empire, belonging, migration, and diaspora   Homeward Bound shines a light on a neglected aspect of twentieth-century migration history. It compares two groups of migrants--Southern Irish Protestants and the British in India--who ""returned"" to Britain from Ireland and India after independence in 1922 and 1947. By looking across national boundaries, Niamh Dillon explores both individual and collective narratives of imperial identity in the late British Empire and the prompts for return.  For both groups, the success of national independence movements in the first half of the twentieth century was cataclysmic and prompted a large-scale migration to Britain. Between 1911 and 1926, the number of Protestants in the Irish Free State dropped from approximately 313,000 to 208,000, and much of the British population left India. Although these numbers are significant, these two groups have largely been ignored by historians and have not been compared before.  Though instability in the new political order and lack of livelihood were determining factors in the decision to migrate, Dillon argues that Southern Irish Protestants and the British community in India ""returned"" to Britain after independence principally because these former elites no longer had a clearly defined role in the new post-colonial era. Return migrants chose Britain because of continuing connections with it as ""home,"" but often found their colonial experience was not valued in a country re-orienting itself to the post-war order. Through interviews with those who experienced these events first-hand and the recently opened files of the Irish Grants Committee at the National Archives in Britain, this book offers new insights into the history of migration and the affinity these migrants felt with Britain and with the empire.","New York : New York University Press, 2023.",English,,Includes bibliographical references and index.,1 online resource (pages cm.) :,,,,,010787416,"Homeward Bound shines a light on a neglected aspect of twentieth-century migration history.

Honour-based violence and forced marriages : community and restorative practices in Europe - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Rigoni, Clara","In the last 20 years, the related phenomena of honour-based violence and forced marriages have received increasing attention at the international and European level. Punitive responses towards this type of violence have been adopted, including ad hoc criminalisation and legislation containing direct references to the concepts of honour, culture, and tradition. However, criminal law-based responses present several shortcomings and have often disregarded the specific needs that victims of such crimes might encounter. This book examines the possibility of using alternative programmes to address cases of honour-based violence and forced marriages. After reviewing previous existing literature, it presents new empirical data. Introducing a case study from the United Kingdom, the book recalls the debate on Sharia Councils and the Muslim Arbitration Tribunal, but examines instead other community-based secular programmes. By comparison, a study from Norway on the work of the National Mediation Agency and the so-called Cross-Cultural Transformative Mediation model is investigated as part of a larger multi-agency approach. Ultimately, in an attempt to reconcile pluralism and the rule of law, the book proposes effective ways to tackle honour crimes based on cooperation and individualisation of the proceedings, and capable of improving women's access to justice and reducing secondary victimisation.","Abingdon, Oxon ; New York, NY : Routledge, 2023.",English,,Description based on print version record.Includes bibliographical references and index.,"1 online resource (viii, 275 pages)",File type: text file,Electronic books,,LCCN: 2022010951,010693513,The book examines the possibility of using alternative programmes to address cases of honour-based violence and forced marriages.

This book offers a comprehensive chronological survey of Black horror from the 1890s to present day.In this second edition, Robin R. Means Coleman expands upon the history of notable characterizations of Blackness in horror cinema, with new chapters spanning the 1960s, 2000s, and 2010s to the present, and examines key levels of Black participation on screen and behind the camera.

"Hospital city, health care nation : race, capital, and the costs of American health care - Duke University Libraries Catalog",,"McKee, Guian A.","Hospital City, Health Care Nation recasts the story of the U.S. health care system by emphasizing its economic, social, and medical importance in American communities. Focusing on urban hospitals and academic medical centers, the book argues that the country's high level of health care spending has allowed such institutions to become vital, if often problematic, economic anchors for communities. Yet that spending has also constrained possibilities for comprehensive health care reform over many decades, even after the passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010. At the same time, the role of hospitals in urban renewal, in community health provision, and as employers of low-wage workers has contributed directly to racial health disparities. Guian A. McKee explores these issues through a detailed historical case study of Baltimore's Johns Hopkins Hospital while also tracing their connections across governmental scales--local, state, and federal. He shows that health care spending and its consequences, rather than insurance coverage alone, are core issues in the decades-long struggle over the American health care system. In particular, Hospital City, Health Care Nation points to the increased role of financial capital after the 1960s in shaping not only hospital growth but also the underlying character of these vital institutions. The book shows how hospitals' quest for capital has interacted with structural racism and inequality to shape and constrain the U.S. health care system. Building on this reassessment of the hospital system, its politics, and its financing, Hospital City, Health Care Nation offers ideas for the next steps in health care reform.","Philadelphia : University of Pennsylvania Press, [2023]",English,,Includes bibliographical references and index.The Dr. William Reid Haas and Mrs. Ardelle B.

How Dark Is My Flower. - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,,"The poetry of Yosano Akiko covers all the many and varied aspects of the experience of love--from early romantic encounters between the lover and beloved to the intimate pleasures of mutual infatuation and then true love. The journey outlined in Akiko's verse also grapples with jealousy and unrequited passion, as Akiko's poem-narrative treats the rivalry between herself and her best friend, the poet Yamakawa Tomiko, for the affection of the dashing young literary lion, Yosano Tekkan, who later became Akiko's husband. Thus, How Dark Is My Flower: Yosano Akiko and the Invention of Romantic Love tells a number of stories: a real-life romance unfolds in the poetry of these three poets examined in the book, as well as the story of the journey from romanticism to modernism undertaken by early 20th century Japanese poetry.

This volume explains what has gone wrong, and what steps should be taken for psychology to become a constructive international force. Historically, psychologists have focused only on causal explanations of behavior, neglecting normatively regulated behavior and intentionality. By giving greater importance to context and collective processes, moving from 'societies to cells,' psychologists can better understand and explain individual behavior. Poverty is an extremely powerful context that shapes cognitions and actions, with destructive consequences for disadvantaged individuals. The advocation of 'be happy psychology' and 'resilience' as solutions to problems faced by the disadvantaged leads to entrenched group-based inequalities, with the poor stuck at the bottom.

This book aims to build a general theory of catastrophes--a new form of apocalyptic thinking that is grounded in science and philosophy.

Human Brain and Spinal Cord Tumors : From Bench to Bedside. Volume 1 - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,Rezaei,"Brain tumors comprise about 5-9% of all human neoplasms; and interestingly the central nervous system (CNS) neoplasms are ranked among the most prevalent neoplasms of childhood as well. Besides to the morphologic and histopathologic characteristics, and as each pathologic states first starts with molecular alterations, each tumor may have its own story in the matter of activating tumorigenesis pathways and having specific molecular characteristics. Importantly, the molecular classification of tumors has been highly considered in the past few decades for taking the most appropriate therapeutic approach. On the other hand, the tumors shall have tumor-scape mechanisms preventing the immunologic system to eliminate its invasion. The failure of innate and acquired immune system to defeat tumorigenesis mechanisms would consequently result in tumor development. Interestingly, the neuro-immunologic mechanism plays a role in development of psychiatric manifestations of brain tumors as well. Taking all these to account, the different arms of innate immunity, acquired immunity, and genetics have been approached to defeat development and/or progression of such tumors. Accordingly, the activation immunotherapeutic approaches focus on activating or strengthening the anti-tumor immunologic pathways in order to assist the weakened immune system to defeat the tumor (such as Dendritic cell vaccination, DNA vaccines, peptide vaccines, viral vector-based vaccines, monoclonal antibodies, and CAR T-cell therapy). In addition to immunologic components of brain and spinal cord tumors, numerous genes and genetic pathways have been recognized to take part in tumorigenesis. Taking these non-immune genetic pathways to account, some other therapeutic approaches such as stem cell therapy and gene therapy have been developed in the new era of cancer treatment. Moreover, and besides the biologic and medical aspects of these tumors, different physical/mathematical models have been proposed to either explain or predict tumor behavior. Such models would be advantageous in developing new therapeutic modalities in pre-clinical stages and enter new eras in cancer treatment.","[Place of publication not identified] : Springer International Publishing, 2023.",,,Title from content provider.,1 online resource,,,,,010854693,Brain and Spinal Cord Tumors comprise about 5-9% of all human neoplasms.

The human side of innovation : the power of people in love with people - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Porcini, Mauro","PepsiCo's award-winning chief design officer reveals the secret to creating life-changing innovations- putting human needs at the center of any design process.   ""Innovation is an act of love-or at least it should be. Always. It is a gesture of empathy, respect, generosity, of one human being's devotion to another,"" writes Mauro Porcini at the beginning of this extraordinary book.  It is in part a memoir by one of the world's leading designers-the first chief design officer at both 3M and Pepsi. But even more, it is a manifesto for a genuine, authentic, and deeply humanistic approach to design, one that aims to create personal and social value first and financial and economic value afterward.  In every industry, new technologies have lowered the barrier to entry like never before. Either you design exceptional products or somebody will beat you to it. Porcini shows, through example after example and story after story, that the key to real, world-changing innovation is to put people first-not only the people we innovate for but also the people who lead the innovation process.  Putting people first requires what Porcini calls unicorns- people who are in love with people, who have a genuine fire in them to create meaningful solutions for actual human beings. In this book, he describes them, celebrates them, and details their superpowers so you can find them, hire them, grow them, and retain them.  Some are qualities you might expect-the ability to dream combined with the ability to execute. But when was the last time you heard an executive ask prospective hires if they were kind, optimistic, curious, or humble?

Hume's Imagination - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,Magri,"This book proposes a new and systematic interpretation of the mental nature, function and structure, and importance of the imagination in Book 1, 'Of the Understanding', of Hume's Treatise of Human Nature. The proposed interpretation has deeply revisionary implications for Hume's philosophy of mind and for his naturalism, epistemology, and stance to scepticism. The book remedies a surprising blindspot in Hume scholarship and contributes to the current, lively philosophical debate on imagination. Hume's philosophy, if rightly understood, gives suggestions about how to treat imagination as a mental natural kind, its cognitive complexity and variety of functions notwithstanding.  Hume's imagination is a faculty of inference and the source of a distinctive kind of idea, which complements our sensible representations of objects. Our cognitive nature, if restricted to the representation of objects and of their relations, would leave ordinary and philosophical cognition seriously underdetermined and expose us to scepticism. Only the non-representational, inferential faculty of the imagination can put in place and vindicate ideas like causation, body, and self, which support our cognitive practices. The book reconstructs how Hume's naturalist inferentialism about the imagination develops this fundamental insight. Its five parts deal with the dualism of representation and inference; the explanation of generality and modality; the production of causal ideas; the production of spatial and temporal content, and the distinction of an external world of bodies and an internal one of selves; and the replacement of the understanding with imagination in the analysis of cognition and in epistemology.","[Place of publication not identified] : Oxford University Press, Incorporated, 2023.",,,Title from content provider.,1 online resource,,,,,010759897,"This book proposes a new and systematic interpretation of the mental nature, function and structure of the imagination in Book 1, 'Of the Understanding', of Hume's Treatise of Human Nature.

Hume's Philosophy In Historical Perspective - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Stewart, M. A.","David Hume was a highly original thinker. Nevertheless, he was a writer of his time and place in the history of philosophy. In this book, M. A. Stewart puts Hume's writing in context, particularly that of his native Scotland, but also that of British and European philosophy more generally. Through meticulous research Stewart brings to life the circumstances by means of which we can get a deeper understanding of Hume's writings on the nature and reach of human reason, the foundation of morals, and, especially, on the philosophy of religion. Stewart pays particular attention to Hume's intellectual development, beginning with his education at the College of Edinburgh, the writing of his Treatise of Human Nature, and his subsequent philosophical responses to criticisms of that book. He argues that Hume's scepticism set him at odds with the Christian Stoicism of Scottish contemporaries including that of Francis Hutcheson - and shows that this conflict played a major role in his failure to obtain the Edinburgh Moral Philosophy Chair in 1745. Stewart's detailed study of the physical character of Hume's surviving manuscripts in Chapters 8 and 9 provides the best available dating of his early 'Essay on Modern Chivalry', his 'Early Fragment on Evil' and the periods of composition of his Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion. Other chapters compare Hume's theory of abstraction with that of Locke and Berkeley, provide the 17th and 18th century philosophical context of the central argument of his essay 'Of miracles', and consider the 18th and 19th century reception of his writings in England and Ireland.","[Place of publication not identified] : Oxford University Press, 2023.",,,Title from content provider.,1 online resource,,,,,010759898,"M.

I SAW DEATH COMING : A HISTORY OF TERROR AND SURVIVAL IN THE WAR AGAINST RECONSTRUCTION. - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Williams, Kidada E.","""Powerful and deeply moving.""-- Los Angeles Times   From a groundbreaking scholar, a heart-wrenching reexamination of the struggle for survival in the Reconstruction-era South, and what it cost.  The story of Reconstruction is often told from the perspective of the politicians, generals, and journalists whose accounts claim an outsized place in collective memory. But this pivotal era looked very different to African Americans in the South transitioning from bondage to freedom after 1865. They were besieged by a campaign of white supremacist violence that persisted through the 1880s and beyond. For too long, their lived experiences have been sidelined, impoverishing our understanding of the obstacles post-Civil War Black families faced, their inspiring determination to survive, and the physical and emotional scars they bore because of it.  In I Saw Death Coming , Kidada E. Williams offers a breakthrough account of the much-debated Reconstruction period, transporting readers into the daily existence of formerly enslaved people building hope-filled new lives. Drawing on overlooked sources and bold new readings of the archives, Williams offers a revelatory and, in some cases, minute-by-minute record of nighttime raids and Ku Klux Klan strikes. And she deploys cutting-edge scholarship on trauma to consider how the effects of these attacks would linger for decades--indeed, generations--to come.  For readers of Carol Anderson, Tiya Miles, and Clint Smith, I Saw Death Coming is an indelible and essential book that speaks to some of the most pressing questions of our times.",NEW YORK/LONDON BLOOMSBURY 2023.,,,,,,,,,010783384,"The story of Reconstruction is often told from the perspective of politicians, generals, and journalists.

Idea of the Book and the Creation of Literature - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,Orgel,"The Idea of the Book and the Creation of Literature explores the intersection of literary history and the history of the book. For several millennia, books have been the material embodiment of knowledge and culture, and an essential embodiment for any kind of knowledge involving texts. Texts, however, do not need to be books-they are not even necessarily written. The oldest poems were composed to be recited, and only written down centuries later. Much of the most famous poetry of the English Renaissance was composed in manuscript form to circulate among a small social circle. Plays began as scripts for performance. What happens to a play when it becomes a book, or to a collection of poems circulated among friends when it becomes a volume of sonnets? How do essays, plays, poems, stories, become Works? How is an author imagined?

In this fully updated second edition of Identity Theory, Peter J. Burke and Jan E. Stets expand and refine theirdiscussion of identity theory. Each chapter has been significantly revised and chapters have been added to address new theoretical developments and empirical research in the field. They cover identity characteristics, the processes and outcomes of identity verification, and the operation ofidentities to detail in particular the role of emotional, behavioral, and cognitive processes. In addition, Burke and Stets explore the multiple identities individuals hold from their multiple positions in society and organizations as well as the multiple identities activated by many peopleinteracting in groups and organizations.

Ignition Sources - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,RAMAMURTHI,"This book discusses the different energy sources bringing about fires, explosions, and detonations in combustibles under different levels of confinement. Focus is on the initiation source for a combustible whether it is a gas, a liquid, or a solid in a given state of confinement. Incidents of oxygen-related fires in hospitals which were particularly evident with increased usage of oxygen therapy for the extremely ill COVID-19 patients in 2021 are discussed with details of formation, accumulation, and dissipation of charges and their discharges leading to fires and explosions. Sympathetic detonations, BLEVE explosions, cook-off tests of combustibles, the inadvertent ignition sources (threats), and their control are discussed. Sporadic Ignition of wildfires in a heat dome augmented by the reflection of expansion disturbances from the interfaces separating media of different acoustic impedances are explored. Spontaneous human combustion, pilot ignition, shock wave ignition, ignition of fuel droplets and conditions under which fires, explosions, and detonations take place are discussed. Different ways of mitigating the inadvertent initiation of explosions and detonations are given at the end.","[Place of publication not identified] : Springer International Publishing, 2023.",,,Title from content provider.,1 online resource,,,,,010854720,"This book discusses the different energy sources bringing about fires, explosions, and detonations in combustibles under different levels of confinement.

Ignorance and Moral Responsibility - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Zimmerman, Michael J.","Michael J. Zimmerman investigates the relation between ignorance and moral responsibility. He begins with the presentation of a case in which a tragedy occurs, one to which many people have unwittingly contributed, and addresses the question of whether their ignorance absolves them of blame for what happened. Inspection of the case issues in the Argument from Ignorance, whose conclusion is that, to be blameworthy for one's behaviour and its consequences, one must at some time in the history of that behaviour have known that one was engaged in wrongdoing-a thesis that threatens to undermine many everyday ascriptions of responsibility. This argument is examined and refined in ensuing chapters by way of, first, a detailed inquiry into the nature of moral responsibility, ignorance, and control, all of which play a crucial role in the argument, and then an application of the fruits of this investigation to the question of whether and how someone might be to blame for behaviour that stems from either culpable ignorance, negligence, recklessness, or the kind of fundamental moral ignorance that often characterizes evildoers. The Argument from Ignorance implies that in a great many such cases the agent has an excuse for the wrongdoing in question. This is a disturbing verdict, and in the final chapter challenges to the argument are entertained. Despite the merits of some of these challenges, it is held that the argument, revised one last time, survives them.","[Place of publication not identified] : Oxford University Press, Incorporated, 2023.",,,Title from content provider.,1 online resource,,,,,010722406,"Michael J.

"Ignorance, irony, and knowledge in Plato - Duke University Libraries Catalog",,"Crotty, Kevin, 1948-","Socrates famously claimed that he knew nothing, and that wisdom consisted in awareness of one's ignorance. In Ignorance, Irony and Knowledge in Plato, Kevin Crotty makes the case for the centrality and fruitfulness of Socratic ignorance throughout Plato's philosophical career. Knowing that you don't know is more than a maxim of intellectual humility; Plato shows how it lies at the basis of all the virtues, and inspires dialogue, the best and most characteristic activity of the philosophical life. Far from being simply a lack or deficit, ignorance is a necessary constituent of genuine knowledge. Crotty explores the intricate ironies involved in the paradoxical relationship of ignorance and knowledge. He argues, further, that Plato never abandoned the historical Socrates to pursue his own philosophical agenda. Rather, his philosophical career can be largely understood as a progressive deepening of his appreciation of Socratic ignorance. Crotty presents Plato as a forerunner of the scholarly interest in ignorance that has gathered force in a wide variety of disciplines over the last 20 years.","Lanham : Lexington Books, [2023]",English,,Includes bibliographical references (pages 237-244) and index.,"ix, 249 pages ; 24 cm",,,1352248196.0,LCCN: 2022042050,010850770,"In Ignorance, Irony and Knowledge in Plato, Kevin Crotty makes the case for the centrality and fruitfulness of Socratic ignorance throughout Plato's philosophical career.

In this period of his ongoing annual lecture series, the acclaimed philosopher took up the existential problem of how to be contemporary with one's own time-that is, how to not simply inhabit a passing moment but bring a real present into existence.  Images of the Present Time presents nearly three years of Badiou's seminars, held from 2001 to 2004, partly against the backdrop of the war in Iraq. Given while Badiou was writing Logics of Worlds, the second of the three volumes of Being and Event, these lectures address some of the same questions of existence in a particular world in a more personal and conversational tone, with reference to literature, philosophy, and contemporary politics and culture. He proposes a new concept of living in a real present as the twisting together of something from the past and something of the future.

Imaginary empires : women writers and alternative futures in early US literature - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"O'Malley, Maria, 1976-","In Imaginary Empires , Maria O?Malley examines early American texts published between 1767 and 1867 whose narratives represent women?s engagement in the formation of empire. Her analysis unearths a variety of responses to contact, exchange, and cohabitation in the early United States, stressing the possibilities inherent in the literary to foster participation, resignification, and rapprochement.  New readings of The Female American, Leonora Sansay?s Secret History, Catharine Maria Sedgwick?s Hope Leslie, Lydia Maria Child?s A Romance of the Republic, and Harriet Jacobs?s Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl confound the metaphors of ghosts, haunting, and amnesia that proliferate in many recent studies of early US literary history. Instead, as O?Malley shows, these writings foreground acts of foundational violence involved in the militarization of domestic spaces, the legal impediments to the transfer of property and wealth, and the geopolitical standing of the United States. Racialized and gendered figures in the texts refuse to die, leave, or stay silent. In imagining different kinds of futures, these writers reckon with the ambivalent role of women in empire-building as they negotiate between their own subordinate position in society and their exertion of sovereignty over others.

Improvement of plant production in the era of climate change - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Fahad, Shah (Assistant professor of agriculture)","Current trends in population growth suggest that global food production is unlikely to meet future demands under projected climate change scenarios unless the pace of plant improvement is accelerated. Plant production is facing many challenges due to changing environmental conditions and the growing demand for new plant-derived materials. These challenges come at a time when plant science is making significant progress in understanding the basic processes of plant growth and development. Major abiotic stresses like drought, heat, cold and salinity often cause a range of morphological, physiological, biochemical, and molecular changes affecting plant growth, development, and productivity; so sustainable food production poses a serious challenge to much of the world, particularly in emerging countries.

In praise of ambivalence - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Coates, D. Justin","Ambivalence is a form of inner volitional conflict that we experience as being irresolvable without significant cost. Because of this, very few of us relish feelings of ambivalence. Yet for many in the Western philosophical tradition, ambivalence is not simply an unappealing experience that'shard to manage. According to Unificationists--whose view finds its historical roots in Plato and Augustine and is ably defended by contemporary philosophers such as Harry Frankfurt and Christine Korsgaard--ambivalence is a failure of well-functioning agency. The reasons for this, we're told, arethreefold. First, it precludes agents from resolving their wills in a way that is necessary for autonomy. Second, it precludes agents from fully affirming their live and, in particular, from fully affirming the choices they make. As a result, ambivalence robs them of an important source of meaning.Finally, ambivalence causes agents to act in self-defeating ways. In so doing, they act without integrity. Ambivalence is thus seen as a threat to a trio of important agential goods, and as a result, it imperils the best forms of human agency.Against the Unificationists, D. Justin Coates argues that ambivalence does not preclude volitional resolution or normatively significant forms of affirmation. Nor does it guarantee self-defeat. Consequently, ambivalence as such is no threat to autonomy, meaning, or integrity. In assessing thesearguments, ambivalence is also revealed to have an important role in securing the very goods that unificationists contend it undermines. The reason for this is that each of these goods requires the agent to be normatively competent. But normative competence itself, Coates argues, often leads agentsto be ambivalent. The best forms of human agency are therefore shown to be not only compatible with ambivalence but as regularly requiring it. Ambivalence is thus not a volitional defect, but a crucial constituent of well-functioning agency.","New York, NY, United States of America : Oxford University Press, [2023]",English,,Description based on print version record.Includes bibliographical references and index.,1 online resource (pages cm),File type: text file,,,LCCN: 2022029982,010759940,"For many in the Western philosophical tradition, ambivalence is not simply an unappealing experience that'shard to manage.

In praise of failure : four lessons in humility - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Brădățan, Costică","Squarely challenging a culture obsessed with success, an acclaimed philosopher argues that failure is vital to a life well lived, curing us of arrogance and self-deception and engendering humility instead.   Our obsession with success is hard to overlook. Everywhere we compete, rank, and measure. Yet this relentless drive to be the best blinds us to something vitally important: the need to be humble in the face of life's challenges. Costica Bradatan mounts his case for failure through the stories of four historical figures who led lives of impact and meaning--and assiduously courted failure. Their struggles show that engaging with our limitations can be not just therapeutic but transformative.  In Praise of Failure explores several arenas of failure, from the social and political to the spiritual and biological. It begins by examining the defiant choices of the French mystic Simone Weil, who, in sympathy with exploited workers, took up factory jobs that her frail body could not sustain. From there we turn to Mahatma Gandhi, whose punishing quest for purity drove him to ever more extreme acts of self-abnegation. Next we meet the self-styled loser E. M. Cioran, who deliberately turned his back on social acceptability, and Yukio Mishima, who reveled in a distinctly Japanese preoccupation with the noble failure, before looking to Seneca to tease out the ingredients of a good life.  Gleefully breaching the boundaries between argument and storytelling, scholarship and spiritual quest, Bradatan concludes that while success can make us shallow, our failures can lead us to humbler, more attentive, and better lived lives. We can do without success, but we are much poorer without the gifts of failure.","Cambridge, Massachusetts : Harvard University Press, 2023.",English,,Includes bibliographical references and index.,1 online resource (1 volume.) :,File type: text file,,,,010743788,"In Praise of Failure explores several arenas of failure, from the social and political to the spiritual and biological.

"Indian classical music and the gramophone, 1900-1930 - Duke University Libraries Catalog",,"Sampath, Vikram","In 1902 The Gramophone Company in London sent out recording experts on ""expeditions"" across the world to record voices from different cultures and backgrounds. All over India, it was women who embraced the challenge of overcoming numerous social taboos and aesthetic handicaps that came along with this nascent technology. Women who took the plunge and recorded largely belonged to the courtesan community, called tawaifs and devadasis , in North and South India, respectively. Recording brought with it great fame, brand recognition, freedom from exploitative patrons, and monetary benefits to the women singers. They were to become pioneers of the music industry in the Indian sub-continent. However, despite the pioneering role played by these women, their stories have largely been forgotten. Contemporaneous with the courtesan women adapting to recording technology was the anti-nautch campaign that sought to abolish these women from the performing space and brand them as common prostitutes. A vigorous renaissance and arts revival movement followed, leading to the creation of a new classical paradigm in both North Indian (Hindustani) and South Indian (Carnatic) classical music. This resulted in the standardization, universalization, and institutionalization of Indian classical music. This newly created classical paradigm impacted future recordings of The Gramophone Company in terms of a shift in genres and styles.

Indigenous language politics in the schoolroom : cultural survival in Mexico and the United States - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Gellman, Mneesha","Public school classrooms around the world have the power to shape and transform youth culture and identity. In this book, Mneesha Gellman examines how Indigenous high school students resist assimilation and assert their identities through access to Indigenous language classes in public schools. Drawing on ethnographic accounts, qualitative interviews, focus groups, and surveys, Gellman's fieldwork examines and compares the experiences of students in Yurok language courses in Northern California and Zapotec courses in Oaxaca, Mexico. She contends that this access to Indigenous language instruction in secondary schooling serves as an arena for Indigenous students to develop their sense of identity and agency, and provides them tools and strategies for civic, social, and political participation, sometimes in unexpected ways.  Showcasing young people's voices, and those of their teachers and community members, in the fight for culturally relevant curricula and educational success, Gellman demonstrates how the Indigenous language classroom enables students to understand, articulate, and resist the systemic erasure and destruction of their culture embedded in state agendas and educational curricula. Access to Indigenous language education, she shows, has positive effects not only for Indigenous students, but for their non-Indigenous peers as well, enabling them to become allies in the struggle for Indigenous cultural survival.

Injustice in urban sustainability : ten core drivers - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Kotsila, Panagiota","This book uses a unique typology of ten core drivers of injustice to explore and question common assumptions around what urban sustainability means, how it can be implemented, and how it is manifested in or driven by urban interventions that hinge on claims of sustainability. Aligned with critical environmental justice studies, the book highlights the contradictions of urban sustainability in relation to justice. It argues that urban neighbourhoods cannot be greener, more sustainable and liveable unless their communities are strengthened by the protection of the right to housing, public space, infrastructure and healthy amenities. Linked to the individual drivers, ten short empirical case studies from across Europe and North America provide a systematic analysis of research, policy and practice conducted under urban sustainability agendas in cities such as Barcelona, Glasgow, Athens, Boston and Montréal, and show how social and environmental justice is, or is not, being taken into account. By doing so, the book uncovers the risks of continuing urban sustainability agendas while ignoring, and therefore perpetuating, systemic drivers of inequity and injustice operating within and outside of the city.Accessibly written for students in urban studies, critical geography and planning, this is a useful and analytical synthesis of issues relating to urban sustainability, environmental and social justice.The Open Access version of this book, available at http: //www.taylorfrancis.com/books/e/9781003221425, has been made available under a Creative Commons Attribution-Non Commercial-No Derivatives 4.0 license.

Based on extensive original research, taking a multidisciplinary approach, and including detailed case studies, the book explains why, despite these efforts, Russia is performing comparatively poorly in innovation outcomes.

Die militärische Partizipation an den Napoleonischen Kriegen endete zwar erfolgreich, jedoch brachte sie beinahe die Zahlungsunfähigkeit des Staates mit sich. Obwohl die bayerische Streitmacht nach wie vor den großen Stolz des Landes darstellte, rückte sie fortan in den Fokus der Einsparungspolitik König Ludwigs I. Folglich waren die Mittel, welche der Armee zur Verfügung gestellt wurden, streng reguliert und reichten lediglich dafür aus, um die laufenden Kosten zu decken. Eine schleichende, degenerative Heeresentwicklung - sowohl auf personeller, als auch technischer Ebene - resultierte hieraus. Problematisch wurde diese Vernachlässigung, nachdem immer mehr europäische Streitmächte einen technischen Modernisierungsprozess begannen. Neue Waffensysteme wurden erprobt und eingeführt, die Nutzung der Eisenbahn zur Erhöhung der Mobilität diskutiert. Wie stand die bayerische Armeeführung diesen Entwicklungen gegenüber?

The volume is written from the perspective of women business scholars, thereby offering outside viewpoints in fields that still are very much dominated by men, and fresh insights and innovate ideas. In three main parts, the authors address the need for interdisciplinarity in research to identify ways to ensure the contribution of business to sustainability, showcasing a number of theoretical and applied approaches for researching sustainable business. The volume 's introductory chapter situates the volume in discourses of sustainability and corporate sustainability. It presents the Daughters of Themis Network and provides a short description of the successive eleven chapters. In Part I, Reflections, contributors discuss the significance of interdisciplinary research, how to work across disciplines, as well as the challenges of doing so. In Part II, Theory, contributors discuss theoretical and methodological aspects of interdisciplinary research. Part III presents the Practice of interdisciplinary research. In the introductory chapter, the editors reflect on the insights that can be drawn out of the contributions, and discuss the potential for future developments of interdisciplinary research for sustainability, as well as how interdisciplinary research can be communicated. The book is intended for business scholars, and will particularly appeal to those working in law, accountancy and finance, management, and organization studies. ."

Introducing Computation to Neuroscience - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,Aertsen,"This book brings together a selection of papers by George Gerstein, representing his long-term endeavor of making neuroscience into a more rigorous science inspired by physics, where he had his roots. Professor Gerstein was many years ahead of the ﬁeld, consistently striving for quantitative analyses, mechanistic models, and conceptual clarity. In doing so, he pioneered Computational Neuroscience, many years before the term itself was born.

INTRODUCTION TO QUEER LITERARY STUDIES : READING QUEERLY. - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Stockton, Will","An Introduction to Queer Literary Studies: Reading Queerly is the first introduction to queer theory written especially for students of literature. Tracking the emergence of queer theory out of gay and lesbian studies, this book pays unique attention to how queer scholars have read some of the most well-known works in the English language. Organized thematically, this book explores queer theoretical treatments of sexual identity, gender and sexual norms and normativity, negativity and utopianism, economics and neoliberalism, and AIDS activism and disability. Each chapter expounds upon foundational works in queer theory by scholars including Michel Foucault, Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick, and Lee Edelman. Each chapter also offers readings of primary texts -ranging from the highly canonical, like John Milton's Paradise Lost, to more contemporary works of popular fiction, like Stephen King's 'Salem's Lot. Along the way, An Introduction to Queer Literary Studies: Reading Queerly demonstrates how queer reading methods work alongside other methods like feminism, historicism, deconstruction, and psychoanalysis. By modelling queer readings, this book invites literature students to develop queer readings of their own. It also suggests that reading queerly is not simply a matter of reading work written by queer people. Queer reading attunes us to the queerness of even the most straightforward text.

Inverse scattering theory and transmission eigenvalues - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Cakoni, Fioralba","Inverse scattering theory is a major theme in applied mathematics, with applications to such diverse areas as medical imaging, geophysical exploration, and nondestructive testing. The inverse scattering problem is both nonlinear and ill-posed, thus presenting challenges in the development of efficient inversion algorithms. A further complication is that anisotropic materials cannot be uniquely determined from given scattering data.  In the first edition of Inverse Scattering Theory and Transmission Eigenvalues , the authors discussed methods for determining the support of inhomogeneous media from measured far field data and the role of transmission eigenvalue problems in the mathematical development of these methods. In this second edition, three new chapters describe recent developments in inverse scattering theory.  In particular, the authors explore the use of modified background media in the nondestructive testing of materials and methods for determining the modified transmission eigenvalues that arise in such applications from measured far field data. They also examine nonscattering wave numbers-a subset of transmission eigenvalues-using techniques taken from the theory of free boundary value problems for elliptic partial differential equations and discuss the dualism of scattering poles and transmission eigenvalues that has led to new methods for the numerical computation of scattering poles.  This book will be of interest to research mathematicians and engineers and physicists working on problems in target identification.

The researchers applied a mixed-methods approach to gain insight and a broader perspective of the status quo concerning AI adoption. Important considerations that stem from this study include the need for increased AI knowledge among public administrators since the majority of respondents reported a lack of awareness of AI technologies and their deployment. Understanding AI-related advantages must be accompanied by a robust instructional effort at all levels of education. It was unanimously agreed that the early inclusion of AI-related courses in the Maltese educational system will aid in developing a future AI-savvy workforce.

INVESTMENT TREATY LAW AND CLIMATE CHANGE. - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Restrepo Rodríguez, Tomás","The book deals with the question whether the investment treaty law system could be harmonized with the climate change international legal framework and the climate interest that lies beyond. The answer to this research question is divided into three parts. The first examines the relevance of the climate change international legal framework in investment treaty disputes as a natural pre(logical)interpretative stage. The second focuses on the BIT's content-interpretation, which is the orthodox approach to solve the fragmentation between the system of investment treaty law and the system of international climate change law. Finally, the third part tackles this fragmentation through a heterodox approach that is grounded in the direct application of climate change principles through law ascertainment.

Invisible trillions : how financial secrecy is imperiling capitalism and democracy--and the way to renew our broken system - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Baker, Raymond W., 1935-","""Our current democratic capitalist system is close to imploding. This book is the first to reveal the secret financial system dominating capitalism today and shows how we can create accountability to restore our democracy. Over the last half century, capitalism has created the means for trillions of dollars, euros, pounds, and other stores of wealth to move invisibly-beyond the control of central bankers, law enforcement agents, and international institutions. With an entire financial secrecy system now dominating capitalist operations, riches move inexorably upward and accelerate economic inequality, directly obstructing and threatening democracy. In three parts, Invisible Trillions reveals how capitalism today functions outside the control of democracy and how we can link the two once again. Acknowledging the corruption and complacency of our institutions, Raymond W. Baker walks readers through covert financial operations, their instigators, and their impacts. He also argues for replacing financial secrecy with transparency via mechanisms such as mandated disclosure around corporate and financial entities and operations.

ITALIAN CITY REPUBLICS. - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Dean, Trevor","Now in its fifth edition, The Italian City Republics illustrates how, from the eleventh century onwards, many Italian towns achieved independence as political entities, unhindered by any centralising power. Until the fourteenth century, when the regimes of individual 'tyrants' took over in most towns, these communes were the scene of a precocious, and very well-documented, experiment in republican self-government.In this new edition, Trevor Dean has expanded the book's treatment of women and gender, the early history of the communes and the lives of non-élites. Focusing on the typical medium-sized towns rather than the better-known cities, the authors draw on a rich variety of contemporary material, both documentary and literary, to portray the world of the communes, illustrating the patriotism and public spirit as well as the equally characteristic factional strife which was to tear them apart. Discussion of the artistic and social lives of the inhabitants shows how these towns were the seedbed of the cultural achievements of the early Renaissance. The Bibliography has been updated to a list of Further Reading with the latest scholarship for students to continue their studies.Both students and the general reader interested in Italian history, literature and art will find this accessible book a rewarding and fascinating read.

JEAN GABIN : THE ACTOR WHO WAS FRANCE. - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Harriss, Joseph","When one thinks of the quintessential Frenchman, one likely pictures Jean Gabin (1904-1976). The son of music hall performers, the Paris-born actor grew up in the entertainment business. His onscreen debut in the 1930's marked the beginning of many memorable roles in films such as La Grande Illusion (1937) and Émile Zola's La Bête Humaine (1938). His performances would earn him international recognition and establish his reputation as one of the greatest stars of film noir. Pausing his performances on screen, Gabin joined the Allied struggle of WWII. Serving under General Charles De Gaulle in the Free French Forces as a tank commander, Gabin was awarded several medals for his service. Upon his return to acting after the war, he became the embodiment of the uniquely French spirit - a persona that would define his future roles. In Jean Gabin: The Actor Who Was France, Joseph Harriss tells the story of this French icon. This well-researched biography documents Gabin's life from his start as a reluctant singer and dancer in Parisian music halls to his rise to film superstardom. Harriss recounts the actor's multi-faceted persona, including his famously fiery temper, his tumultuous love affairs - including a six-year relation with the German star Marlene Dietrich - and his military valor.

"A Jewish journey : surviving and thriving in Poland, Israel, and the United States - Duke University Libraries Catalog",,"Ron, Sam, 1924-","A Jewish Journey is the memoir of Sam Ron, born Shmuel Rakowski in Kazimierza-Wielka, a tiny village, or shtetl, near Krakow, Poland, in 1924, which was overtaken by the Nazis in 1939. As opposed to other Holocaust memoirs, the book takes the form of a Q&A with students who have met him to hear his story, underscoring the importance of Holocaust education not only for Sam himself, but also for all those who will never have the opportunity to meet a survivor. It is written in a novelistic form, in order to touch the heart as well as the mind. Ron is one of the oldest living survivors of the Nazi death camps. After the war, he worked for Bericha, an organization that resettled in the Land of Israel orphaned refugees from Europe. He also served in the Haganah fighting force and was what is known as a chalutz, an early settler before the founding of the State of Israel, where he helped found a settlement and served as a soldier in the Haganah, the precursor to the Israel Defense Forces. He subsequently immigrated to the U.S. and was a successful land developer in Akron and Canton, Ohio. Now Sam lives in Boca Raton, Florida, and continues what he has done for over half a century: educating young and old about his experiences of the momentous historical events in which he has taken part.

It offers a comparative analysis that considers both similarities and differences, drawing on historical, social scientific, and religious studies perspectives. The authors address how Jewish-Muslim relations are related to the historical and contemporary context in which they are embedded, the social identity strategies Jews and Muslims and their institutions employ, and their perceived mutual positions in terms of identity and power. The first section reflects on the history and current profile of Jewish and Muslim communities in London and Amsterdam and the development of relations between Jews andMuslims in both cities. The second section engages with sources of conflict and cooperation. Four specific areas that cause tension are explored: the Israeli-Palestinian conflict; antisemitism and Islamophobia; attacks by extremists; and the commemoration of wars and genocides. In addition to 'trigger events', what stands out is the influence of historical factors, public opinion, the 'mainstream' Christian churches and the media, along with the role of government. The volume will be of interest to scholars from fields including religious studies, interfaith studies, Jewish studies, Islamic studies, urban studies, European studies, and social sciences as well as members of the communities concerned, other religious communities, journalists, politicians, and teachers who are interested in Jewish-Muslim relations.","[Place of publication not identified] : Taylor & Francis, 2023.",,,Title from content provider.,1 online resource,,,,,010722448,"The book focuses on the development of bilateral Jewish-Muslim relations in London and Amsterdam since the late-1980s.

Justifying violent protest : law and morality in democratic states - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Greenwood-Reeves, James","This book presents a radical, but compelling, argument that liberal democracies must be able accommodate violent protest. We often think of violent protest as being alien to liberal democracy, an extraordinary occurrence within our peaceful societies. Yet this is simply untrue. Violent protest is a frequent and normal part of democratic life. The real question is: should it be? Can rebellion or riot against government ever be morally justifiable in our society? By framing state demands for obedience as ""legitimacy claims,"" or moral arguments, states who make illogical and unjust laws make weaker arguments for obedience. This in turn gives citizens stronger moral reasons to disobey. Violence can act as moral dialogue - with expressive and instrumental value in denouncing unjust laws - and can have just as important a role in democracy as peaceful protest. This book examines the activism of Hong Kong pro-democracy protesters, Extinction Rebellion, Black Lives Matter, and many other groups internationally, in order to demonstrate that not only can violent protest be acceptable; in times of grave injustice, it is unavoidable. This book will appeal to a broad range of academics, in legal and political theory, sociolegal studies, criminology, history, and philosophy, as well as others with interests in contemporary forms of protest.","Abingdon, Oxon ; New York, NY : Routledge, 2023.",English,,Description based on print version record.Includes bibliographical references and index.,1 online resource (pages cm),File type: text file,,,LCCN: 2022038018,010814241,"This book presents a compelling argument that liberal democracies must accommodate violent protest.

Kautschuk und Arbeit in Kamerun unter deutscher Kolonialherrschaft 1880-1913 - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Oestermann, Tristan","Kautschuk war das wichtigste Exportprodukt Kameruns, denn um 1900 steckte Kautschuk bzw. Gummi weltweit in Dichtungen, Reifen, Kabeln und zahlreichen Gegenstanden des Alltags. Die starke Nachfrage nach diesem Rohstoff loste zwischen 1890 und 1913 einen globalen Kautschukboom aus, der auch die deutsche Kolonie Kamerun pragte. Dieses Buch ist die erste Studie, die die tatsachlichen Arbeitsbeziehungen in einer afrikanischen Kautschukokonomie analysiert. Das koloniale Geschaft mit Kautschuk war keineswegs nur auf Zwang und Gewalt gebaut.

Kennan : a life between worlds - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Costigliola, Frank, 1946-","A definitive biography of the U.S. diplomat and prize-winning historian George F. Kennan   The diplomat and historian George F. Kennan (1904-2005) ranks as one of the most important figures in American foreign policy--and one of its most complex. Drawing on many previously untapped sources, Frank Costigliola's authoritative biography offers a new picture of a man of extraordinary ability and ambition whose idea of containing the Soviet Union helped ignite the Cold War but who spent the next half century trying to extinguish it. Always prescient, Kennan in the 1990s warned that the eastward expansion of NATO would spur a new cold war with Russia.  Even as Kennan championed rational realism in foreign policy, his personal and professional lives were marked by turmoil. And though he was widely respected and honored by presidents and the public, he judged his career a failure because he had been dropped as a pilot of U.S. foreign policy. Impossible to classify, Kennan was a sui generis thinker, a trenchant critic of both communism and capitalism, and a pioneering environmentalist. Living between Russia and the United States, he witnessed firsthand Stalin's tightening grip on the Soviet Union, the collapse of Europe during World War II, and the nuclear arms race of the Cold War.  An absorbing portrait of an eloquent, insightful, and sometimes blinkered iconoclast whose ideas are still powerfully relevant, Kennan invites us to imagine a world that Kennan fought for but was unable to bring about--one not of confrontations and crises but of dialogue and diplomacy.","Princeton : Princeton University Press, [2023]©2023",English,,Includes bibliographical references and index.,"1 online resource ( xxii, 624 pages) :",Color characteristics: polychromeFile type: text file,Biography,,,010783177,"Frank Costigliola's authoritative biography offers a new picture of a man of extraordinary ability and ambition.

Keynes in action : truth and expediency in public policy - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Clarke, P. F.","John Maynard Keynes died in 1946 but his ideas and his example remain relevant today. In this distinctive new account, Peter Clarke shows how Keynes's own career was not simply that of an academic economist, nor that of a modern policy advisor.

Peter Clarke re-examines the full trajectory of Keynes's public career from his role in Paris over the Versailles Treaty to Bretton Woods. He reveals how Keynes's insights as an economic theorist were rooted in his wider intellectual and cultural milieu including Bloomsbury and his friendship with Virginia Woolf as well as his involvement in government business.

The King's Road : Diplomacy and the Remaking of the Silk Road - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Wen, Xin (Historian)","An exciting and richly detailed new history of the Silk Road that tells how it became more important as a route for diplomacy than for trade   The King's Road offers a new interpretation of the history of the Silk Road, emphasizing its importance as a diplomatic route, rather than a commercial one. Tracing the arduous journeys of diplomatic envoys, Xin Wen presents a rich social history of long-distance travel that played out in deserts, post stations, palaces, and polo fields. The book tells the story of the everyday lives of diplomatic travelers on the Silk Road--what they ate and drank, the gifts they carried, and the animals that accompanied them--and how they navigated a complex web of geographic, cultural, and linguistic boundaries. It also describes the risks and dangers envoys faced along the way--from financial catastrophe to robbery and murder.  Using documents unearthed from the famous Dunhuang ""library cave"" in Western China, The King's Road paints a detailed picture of the intricate network of trans-Eurasian transportation and communication routes that was established between 850 and 1000 CE. By exploring the motivations of the kings who dispatched envoys along the Silk Road and describing the transformative social and economic effects of their journeys, the book reveals the inner workings of an interstate network distinct from the Sino-centric ""tributary"" system.  In shifting the narrative of the Silk Road from the transport of commodities to the exchange of diplomatic gifts and personnel, The King's Road puts the history of Eastern Eurasia in a new light.","Princeton : Princeton University Press, [2023]",English,,Includes bibliographical references and index.,1 online resource.,Color characteristics: polychromeFile type: text file,,,,010761610,"The King's Road: Diplomacy and the Remaking of the Silk Road - Duke University Libraries Catalog.

Knowing Science - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Bird, Alexander","In Knowing Science, Alexander Bird presents an epistemology of science that rejects empiricism and gives a central place to the concept of knowledge. Science aims at knowledge and progresses when it adds to the stock of knowledge. That knowledge is social knowing--it is known by the scientific community as a whole. Evidence is that from which knowledge can be obtained by inference. From this, it follows that evidence is knowledge, and is not limited to perception, nor to observation. Observation supplies evidence that is basic relative to a field of enquiry and can be highly non-perceptual. Theoretical knowledge is typically gained by inference to the only explanation, in which competing plausible hypotheses are falsified by the evidence. In cases where not all competing hypotheses are refuted, scientific hypotheses are not known but instead possess varying degrees of plausibility. Plausibilities in the light of the evidence are probabilities and link eliminative explanationism to Bayesian conditionalization. Bird argues that scientific realism and anti-realism as global metascientific claims should be rejected-the track record gives us only local metascientific claims.","[Place of publication not identified] : Oxford University Press, Incorporated, 2023.",,,Title from content provider.,1 online resource,,,,,010760053,"Alexander Bird presents an epistemology of science that rejects empiricism and gives a central place to the concept of knowledge.

This book makes this groundbreaking Tibetan work on meditation accessible in English and opens fascinating windows on early forms of contemplative practice in Tibet. The unabridged, annotated English translation of this Tibetan treatise is preceded by a general introduction situating the author-a pivotal figure in what would become the Nyingma school of Tibetan Buddhism-and his work in historical and doctrinal context. The detailed annotations provide elucidating comments as well as crucial references to the numerous texts quoted by the Tibetan author. Written from the vantage point of the Great Completeness (Dzogchen) and its vehicle of effortless spontaneity, it discusses, in the manner of a doxography, both sutra-based-including Chan-and tantric approaches to meditation."
Langston Hughes in context - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Kutzinski, Vera M., 1956-","Langston Hughes was among the most influential African American writers of the twentieth century. He inspired and challenged readers from Harlem to the Caribbean, Europe, South America, Asia, the African continent, and beyond. To study Langston Hughes is to develop a new sense of the twentieth century. He was more than a man of his times; emerging as a key member of the Harlem Renaissance, his poems, plays, journalism, translations, and prose fiction documented and shaped the world around him. The twenty-nine essays in this volume engage with his at times conflicting investments in populist and modernist literature, his investments in freedom in and beyond the US, and the many genres through which he wrote.

Large-scale convex optimization : algorithms & analyses via monotone operators - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Ryu, Ernest K.","Starting from where a first course in convex optimization leaves off, this text presents a unified analysis of first-order optimization methods - including parallel-distributed algorithms - through the abstraction of monotone operators. With the increased computational power and availability of big data over the past decade, applied disciplines have demanded that larger and larger optimization problems be solved. This text covers the first-order convex optimization methods that are uniquely effective at solving these large-scale optimization problems. Readers will have the opportunity to construct and analyze many well-known classical and modern algorithms using monotone operators, and walk away with a solid understanding of the diverse optimization algorithms.

Later Greek epic and the Latin literary tradition : further explorations - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,,"The volume offers an innovative and systematic exploration of the diverse ways in which Later Greek Epic interacts with the Latin literary tradition. Taking as a starting point the premise that it is probable for the Greek epic poets of the Late Antiquity to have been familiar with leading works of Latin poetry, either in the original or in translation, the contributions in this book pursue a new form of intertextuality, in which the leading epic poets of the Imperial era (Quintus of Smyrna, Triphiodorus, Nonnus, and the author of the Orphic Argonautica) engage with a range of models in inventive, complex, and often covert ways. Instead of asking, in other words, whether Greek authors used Latin models, we ask how they engaged with them and why they opted for certain choices and not for others. Through sophisticated discussions, it becomes clear that intertexts are usually systems that combine ideology, cultural traditions, and literary aesthetics in an inextricable fashion. The book will prove that Latin literature, far from being distinct from the Greek epic tradition of the imperial era, is an essential, indeed defining, component within a common literary and ideological heritage across the Roman empire.","Berlin : De Gruyter, [2023]©2023",English,,Includes bibliographical references and indexes.,216 pages ; 24 cm,,,,International Standard Article Number: 9783110791792,010725271,"The volume offers an innovative and systematic exploration of the diverse ways in which Later Greek Epic interacts with the Latin literary tradition.

Latinx mental health : from surviving to thriving - Duke University Libraries Catalog,,"Delgado-Romero, Edward A.","Despite similar vulnerability to mental illness as the general population, adults within the Latinx community often do not receive treatment for severe mental illnesses. Latinx communities face health disparities and lack of access to mental healthcare due to language barriers, lack of health insurance coverage, lack of cultural competence from healthcare practitioners, and more. It is essential to promote positive mental health practices within the Latinx community and to educate healthcare practitioners in cultural competence. Latinx Mental Health: From Surviving to Thriving focuses on the research and practical experiences that foster cultural resilience and strength. Rather than advocating for an assimilative model of coping, this book focuses on the way that Latinx issues can be studied and addressed in a culturally and linguistically appropriate way.

"Lavender fields : Black women experiencing fear, agency, and hope in the time of COVID-19 - Duke University Libraries Catalog",,"Jordan-Zachery, Julia S., 1971-","Lavender Fields uses autoethnography to explore how Black girls and women are living with and through COVID-19. It centers their pain, joys, and imaginations for a more just future as we confront all the inequalities that COVID-19 exposes.  Black women and girls in the United States are among the hardest hit by the pandemic in terms of illnesses, deaths, evictions, and increasing economic inequality. Riffing off Alice Walker's telling of her search for Zora Neal Hurston, the authors of these essays and reflections offer raw tellings of Black girls' and women's experiences written in real time, as some of the contributors battled COVID-19 themselves.  The essays center Black girls and women and their testimonies in hopes of moving them from the margin to the center. With a diversity of voices and ages, this volume taps into the Black feminine interior, that place where Audre Lorde tells us that feelings lie, to access knowledge--generational, past, and contemporary--to explore how Black women navigate COVID-19. Using womanism and spirituality, among other modalities, the authors explore deep feelings, advancing Black feminist theorizing on Black feminist praxis and methodology.  In centering the stories of Black girls and women's experiences with COVID-19, this work brings much-needed justice and equity to conversations about the pandemic. Just as Walker worked diligently to find Hurston, Lavender Fields attempts to ""find"" Black women amid all we are experiencing, ensuring visibility and attention.
